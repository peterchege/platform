                                        <h2>Why Bonds?</h2>
                                        <p2>Bonds provide a guarantee that projects will be completed as expected – even
                                            if the contractor fails.
                                        </p2>
                                        <br><br>
                                        <p2>Bonds are an inexpensive way to protect the public interest and assure
                                            contracts are completed on time, for the agreed upon price.
                                        </p2>

                                        <h2>Type of Bonds</h2>
                                        <p> Tender Bonds </p>
                                        <p2>This tender bond (or bid bond) is for use where a Procuring entity is
                                            obtaining tenders for a contract and requires a bond as security
                                            against the risk of the successful bidder failing to enter into the
                                            contract. It gives the beneficiary the right to call the bond on demand
                                            within a specified period and for a maximum specified amount.
                                        </p2>
                                        <p> Advance Payment Bond </p>
                                        <p2>This is a down payment given to the principal by the obligee to ensure
                                            that he will perform his obligation as mentioned in the contract. Advance
                                            payment bond guarantees the obligee to complete his contract as per the
                                            agreement covering loss only when the principal cannot be able to refund
                                            the amount given by the obligee.
                                        </p2>
                                        <p> Performance Bonds </p>
                                        <p2>A performance bond is a surety bond issued by an insurance company or a
                                            bank to guarantee satisfactory completion of a project by a principal.
                                            If the principal fails to perform according to the specifications laid
                                            out by the contract (most often due to the bankruptcy of the principal)
                                            the client (obligee) is guaranteed compensation for any monetary loss up
                                            to the amount of the performance bond.
                                        </p2>
                                        <p> Work Permits/Security Bond </p>
                                        <p2>This is a legal authorization which allows a person to take employment in
                                            instances where a person is given permission to work in a country where
                                            one does not hold citizenship.
                                        </p2><br><br>
                                        <p2>The first surety should be the firm employing such a person and the second
                                            surety is the Ins Co. It is the responsibility of the first surety to write
                                            to immigration when such persons leave the organization for the bond to be
                                            cancelled. It is renewable in Kenya after every two years.

                                        <p2>This is a guarantee from a

                                            faithfully abide by all Laws and regulations governing
                                            the payment of Customs revenue together with the
