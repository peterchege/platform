The campaign launch coincided with the International  Day of Happiness which is a day dedicated to inspiring action for                                                               17  a happier world. The campaign ads were centered on the belief  that “Insurance is about people, not things” and sought to build an  emotional connection by focusing on what matters most to people.  This portrays APA as a happy brand that customers would be glad  to associate with. This created a positive essence that we will  continue to leverage to drive higher growth of our retail, portfolio  where we see potential growth for our business.  To this end, we have come out with products focusing on individual  and family cover cross-selling combined solutions for life and  general and targeting medium-size businesses. We have come  up with a package policy for schools to take advantage of the  government directive that all schools should be insured. We have  been strictly monitoring adherence to the customer charter which  was unveiled in 2016. To enhance the customer experience, we  have partially implemented a contact center which is expected to  be fully operational by mid-2019. In 2018 we also amplified our  efforts to build and maintain our client relationships by holding  various client appreciation events across the country.    TECHNOLOGICAL & DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION    As technology disruption continues to take hold, we expect to see the  insurance industry keep investing its capital in digital advancement  and solutions. According to our 2018 Business Environment Study,  80% of companies indicated an increase in IT spending for 2018  and 36% reported a significant increase of greater than 15%. The  role technology plays in meeting customers’ changing wants and  needs across generations is critical. The core of being successful  in innovation is being successful in technology. It’s really about  listening to the customer and adapting that technology to their  needs, we need to listen to the voice of the customer to be  successful. We recently conducted a digital audit across the  Group and found areas of opportunity to digitise our customer  journeys and processes. This audit has given rise to Apollo  Nirvana- our new digital strategy. Nirvana aims to propel us  in just three years to become a digital leader in the market.  The overarching vision for Nirvana is “Insuring happiness with  seamless protection for all customers, at their fingertips”.

Corporate governance plays a leading role in making certain how corporations and  their boards and management are directed, controlled and held to account. Corporate governance therefore encompasses  the systems, practices and procedures by which the individual corporation regulates itself in order to remain competitive,  ethical, sustainable and fair.  The Board of APA Life Assurance Limited follows principles of openness, integrity and accountability in its stewardship of the  Company’s affairs.  It recognises the developing nature of corporate governance and assesses the Company’s compliance  with generally accepted corporate governance practice on a regular basis, directly and through its Board committees and  Management.  The role of the Board is to ensure conformance by focusing on and providing the Company overall strategic  direction and policy-making as well as performance review through accountability and ensuring appropriate monitoring and  supervision.  The Board is also responsible for the overall system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.  The  controls are designed to both safeguard the Company’s assets and ensure the reliability of financial information.  A senior management team, comprising executive directors and senior managers meets regularly to consider issues of  operational and strategic importance to the Company.  Below are the key features of the existing corporate governance practices within the Company which are reviewed and  improved on a regular basis:    1. BOARD OF DIRECTORS         The Board of Directors consists of eight directors out of whom three are independent non-executive directors. The       Chairman of the Board is a non-executive director and the Board meets formally at least four times a year.       The Board is responsible for setting the direction of the Company through the establishment of strategic objectives, key       policies and the approval of budgets.  It monitors the implementation of strategies and policies through a structured       approach to reporting by executive management and consequent accountability.        The directors are actively involved in and bring strong independent judgement on Board deliberations and discussions.        These directors have a wide range of knowledge and experience of local and international markets that is applied to       the formulation of strategic objectives and decision making.       All directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and are entitled to obtain independent       professional advice on the Company’s affairs.       To assist the Board in the discharge of its responsibilities, Board committees have been established. All the Board       committees meet at least four times a year. The committees are as follows: -       (a) Audit and Risk Committee       The audit and risk committee comprises four non-executive directors and the executive director. The committee       is responsible for, inter alia, developing and advising on audit and financial controls and compliance issues of the       Company. It also defines the scope of the internal audit function and acts as a liaison between the external auditors and       management. The current members of the committee are R Schnarwiler (Chairman), P Shah, R M Ashley, D M Ndonye       and A K M Shah.       (b) Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Committee       The ICT committee comprises one non-executive director, the professional nominated under shareholder’s agreement       and the executive director. The committee provides guidance to the Board on ICT requirements for the Company,       provides assurance that the ICT systems in place are able to generate accurate and timely management reports and       also reviews ICT budgets and recommends for their adoption by the Board. The committee also ensures that there are       business continuity plans in place for the Company. The current members of the committee are P H Shah (Chairman),       P Shah and A K M Shah.       (c) Investment Committee       The Board has an investment committee comprising three non-executive directors, board advisor and the executive       director. This committee is responsible for determining the Company’s overall investment strategy and monitoring its       implementation. The current members of the committee are R M Ashley (Chairman), D M Ndonye, S M Shah, P H Shah       and A K M Shah.    20","ANNUAL REPORT AND                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2018    CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (CONTINUED)    1. BOARD OF DIRECTORS (CONTINUED)         (d) Remuneration Committee       The remuneration committee currently consists of three non-executive directors and the Executive Director. Its primary       objective is to ensure that the right calibre of management is recruited and retained and set guidelines for remuneration       of staff. The non-executive directors on the committee are responsible for agreeing the terms of service in respect of       the executive directors.       The committee is also responsible for ensuring that the terms and conditions of service for management and staff is       fair, appropriate and reflect the market conditions. The current members of the committee are D M Ndonye (Chairman),       R Schnarwiler, P J Shah and A K M Shah.    2. INTERNAL CONTROLS         The Company has implemented and maintains internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the       integrity and reliability of the financial statements and to adequately safeguard and maintain accountability of the       Company’s assets. Such controls are based on established policies and procedures and are implemented by trained       personnel with appropriate segregation of duties. The effectiveness of the system of internal controls is monitored       regularly through internal audit function, operational meetings and the annual external audit.    3. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION         The related parties’ transactions with the group companies during the year ending, 31 December 2018 are detailed       under note 35 of these annual report and financial statements.       The remuneration for non-executive directors consists of fees and sitting allowances for their services in connection       with the Board and committee meetings. These fees and allowances are approved by the members at the annual       general meetings.       The aggregate amount of directors’ remuneration for services rendered during the year ending 31 December 2018 are       contained under note 31 of these annual report and financial statements.    4. SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES         The Board is conscious of the Company’s social and environmental responsibilities. Particular attention is given to       projects with a long time positive impact to the society and environment. These include employees’ welfare programmes,       education and health activities, empowering the youth and provision of clean and safe drinking water. The Company       encourages staff to participate and actively supports them in various causes.    5. GOING CONCERN         The directors confirm that the Company has adequate resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future and       therefore the continued use of going concern as a basis of preparing the financial statements is appropriate.

The directors are responsible for ensuring that the Company keeps proper accounting records that are sufficient  to show and explain the transactions of the Company; disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of  the Company; and that enables them to prepare financial statements of the Company that comply with prescribed financial  reporting standards and the requirements of the Kenyan Companies Act 2015. They are also responsible for safeguarding the  assets of the Company and for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.    The directors accept responsibility for the preparation and presentation of these financial statements in accordance with  International Financial Reporting Standards and in the manner required by the Kenyan Companies Act 2015. They also  accept responsibility for:    i. D esigning, implementing and maintaining internal control as they determine necessary to enable the preparation of      financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error;    ii. selecting suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; and    iii.

The valuation was conducted in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and in accordance with the  requirements of the Insurance Act Cap 487 of the Laws of Kenya. Those principles require that prudent principles for future  outgo under contracts, generally based upon the assumptions that current conditions will continue. Provision is therefore  not made for all possible contingencies.  In completing the actuarial valuation, I have relied upon the audited financial statements of the Company.  In my opinion, the insurer’s insurance liabilities of the Company were adequate as at 31 December 2018.

In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and of fair view of the financial position of APA Life Assurance Limited at  31 December 2018, and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International  Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Kenyan Companies Act, 2015.  Basis for Opinion  We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those  standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our  report.  We are independent of the Company in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of  Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of  the financial statements in Kenya, and we have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements  and the IESBA Code.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Other information  The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our  auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements  does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.  In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above  and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our  knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed  on the other information, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to  report that fact.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a  going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting  unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to  do so.  Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements  Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable  assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always  detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,  individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on  the basis of these financial statements.  As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism  throughout the audit. We also:  •	 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design        and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to      provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than      for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the      override of internal control.  •	 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate      in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal      control.  •	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related      disclosures made by the directors.  •	 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit      evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt      on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  •	 If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related      disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are      based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may      cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.  •	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and      whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair      presentation.

For those assets and liabilities measured at fair value, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset           or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When           measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the company uses market observable data as far as possible. If           the fair value of an asset or a liability is not directly observable, it is estimated by the company using valuation           techniques that maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs (e.g. by           use of the market comparable approach that reflects recent transaction prices for similar items or discounted cash           flow analysis). Inputs used are consistent with the characteristics of the asset / liability that market participants           would take into account.            (b) Use of estimates             The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting           estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the group’s accounting           policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates           are significant to the company financial statements are disclosed in note 1(t).     (b) Changes in accounting policy and disclosures   (i) New and amended standards adopted by the Company              The Company has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for their annual reporting            period commencing 1 January 2018.            IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments              The Company has adopted IFRS 9 as issued by the IASB in July 2014 with a date of transition of 1 January 2018,            which resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts previously recognised in the            financial statements. The Company did not early adopt any of IFRS 9 in previous periods.            As permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Company elected not to restate comparative figures.            Any adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities at the date of transition were            recognised in the opening retained earnings and other reserves of the current period. As a result, the comparative            information provided continues to be accounted for in accordance with the company’s previous accounting policy.            The adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in changes in our accounting policies for recognition, classification and            measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and impairment of financial assets. IFRS 9 also significantly            amends other standards dealing with financial instruments as IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’.            Set out below are disclosures relating to the impact of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the Company.    34","ANNUAL REPORT AND                                                                          FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2018    ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)    FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018    1 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)    (b) Changes in accounting policy and disclosures (continued)  (i) New and amended standards adopted by the Company (continued)          IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments (continued)  (a) Classification and measurement of financial instruments                                          Classification    New             Original carrying             New carrying                                        under IAS 39      classification     amount under              amount under  Financial assets                                        under IFRS 9                  IAS 39  Equity investments – quoted                                                        Shs ‘000                     IFRS 9                                        FVTOCI                                                                Shs ‘000  Policy loans                          Loans and         FVTPL                          195,119                                        receivables                                                                           Other receivables                     Loans and         Amortised cost                                          195,119  Reinsurance receivable share of       receivables  liabilities                           Loans and         Amortised cost  2,240                        2,233                                        receivables                                                          Amortised cost  44,450                       44,450                                                            Amortised cost  124,546                      123,618                                                          Amortised cost  Other receivables arising from        Loans and         Amortised cost       75,358                       66,497  direct insurance arrangements         receivables       Amortised cost   2,618,122                    2,615,504  Government securities                 Held to maturity  Amortised cost  Corporate bonds                       Held to maturity  FVTPL               185,116                      184,472  Deposits with financial institutions  Held to maturity  FVTPL               423,327                      420,570  Cash and bank balances                Held to maturity  FVTOCI  Government securities                 FVTOCI                                 21,492                       21,470  Investments in Unit Trusts            FVTOCI                                658,058                      658,058  Unquoted equity investments           FVTOCI  Total financial assets                                                       15,729                       15,729                                                                                 8,970                        8,970                                                                            4,372,527                    4,356,690                                                                                                         35","ANNUAL REPORT AND                                                          FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2018    ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)    FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018    1 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)  (b) Changes in accounting policy and disclosures (continued)  (i) New and amended standards adopted by the Company (continued)          IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments (continued)    (b) Reconciliation of statement of financial position balances from the IAS 39 to IFRS 9:           The Company performed a detailed analysis of its business models for managing financial assets and analysis of their         cash flow characteristics.

Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)  (b) Changes in accounting policy and disclosures (continued)          New standards and interpretations not yet adopted        •	 Amendment to IFRS 1 (Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014–2016 Cycle, issued in December 2016) - The amendment,              applicable to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, deletes certain short-term exemptions and            removes certain reliefs for first-time adopters.        •	 Amendments to IAS 40 titled Transfers of Investment Property (issued in December 2016) – The amendments,            applicable to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, clarify that transfers to or from investment            property should be made when, and only when, there is evidence that a change in use of property has occurred.        •	 IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (issued in May 2017) The new standard, effective for annual periods beginning on or after            1st January 2021, establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance            contracts issued. It also requires similar principles to be applied to reinsurance contracts held and investment            contracts with discretionary participation features issued. The objective is to ensure that entities provide relevant            information in a way that faithfully represents those contracts. The Company does not issue insurance contracts        The Directors do not plan to apply any of the above until they become effective. Based on their assessment of the        potential impact of application of the above, with the exception of IFRS 16 and IFRS 17, they do not expect that there        will be a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements. There are no other standards that are not yet        effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the entity in the current or future reporting periods and        on near future transactions        There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material        impact on the Company.    (c) Revenue recognition       (i) Revenue          For long term insurance business, premiums are recognised as revenue when they become payable by the policyholder.        For single premium business, revenue is recognised on the date on which the policy is effective. Premiums are shown        before deduction of commission. Long term business relates to the underwriting of risks relating to death of an insured        person, and includes contracts subject to the payment of premiums for a term dependent on the termination or        continuance of the life of an insured person         (ii) Other income          Commissions receivable are recognised as income in the period in which they are earned.        Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis that takes into account the effective yield on the asset.        Dividends receivable are recognised as income in the period in which the right to receive payment is established.        Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.    (d) Claims incurred          Claims and policyholders’ benefits payable comprise claims paid in the year and changes in the provision for insurance        contract liabilities. Claims are recorded as an expense when they are incurred. Claims arising on maturing policies are        recognised when the claims become due for payment. Death claims are accounted for on notification while surrenders        are accounted for on payment.    38","ANNUAL REPORT AND                                              FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2018    ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)    FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018    1. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)  (e) Deposit administration contracts         The Company administers the funds of a number of retirement benefit schemes. The Company’s liabilities in relation to       these schemes have been treated as payables in the statement of financial position. The liabilities with respect to the       deposit administration contracts are determined by the Consulting Actuary on an annual basis.    (f) Insurance contract liabilities         The Company issues contracts that transfer insurance risk or financial risk or both. Insurance contracts are those       contracts that transfer significant insurance risk. Such contracts may also transfer financial risk. As a general guideline,       the Company defines as significant insurance risk the possibility of having to pay benefits on the occurrence of an       insured event that are at least 10% more than the benefits payable if the insured event did occur.       Insurance contract liabilities represent the estimated ultimate cost of settling all claims arising from incidents occurring       prior to the end of the reporting period, but not settled at that date. Insurance contract liabilities are computed on the       basis of the best information available at the time the records for the year are closed, and include provisions for claims       intimated but not paid. Insurance contract liabilities are not discounted.    (g) Reinsurance         The Company assumes and cedes reinsurance in the normal course of business, with retention limits varying by line of       business. Ceded reinsurance arrangements do not relieve the Company from its obligations to policyholders. Premiums       on reinsurance assumed are recognised as income in the same manner as they would be if the reinsurance were       considered direct business. Premiums ceded and claims reimbursed are presented on a gross basis in profit and loss and       statement of financial position as appropriate. Reinsurance assets represent balances due from reinsurance companies.       Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the outstanding claims provision or       settled claims associated with the reinsurer’s policies and are in accordance with the related reinsurance contract.       Impairment occurs when there is objective evidence as a result of an event that occurred after initial recognition of       the reinsurance asset that the Company may not receive all outstanding amounts due under the terms of the contract       and the event has a reliably measurable impact on the amounts that the Company will receive from the reinsurer. The       impairment loss is recognised in the profit or loss.    The Company also assumes reinsurance risk in the normal course of business for life insurance and non-life insurance  contracts where applicable.  Reinsurance assets or liabilities are derecognized when the contractual rights are extinguished or expire or when the  contract is transferred to another party. Premiums and claims on assumed reinsurance are recognised as revenue or  expenses in the same manner as they would be if the reinsurance were considered direct business, taking into account  the product classification of the reinsured business. Reinsurance liabilities represent balances due to reinsurance  companies. Amounts payable are estimated in a manner consistent with the related reinsurance contract.    (h) Equipment    All equipment are initially recorded at cost less depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. The useful lives  used in determining depreciation charge are:    Computer equipment 			             3 years    Motor vehicles 			                 4 years    Furniture fittings and equipment	  8 years    The residual values of items of equipment and their estimated useful lives are reviewed at the reporting date and  adjusted if appropriate. Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is  written down immediately to its recoverable amount.    Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are determined by reference to their carrying amounts.                                                                                                                   39","ANNUAL REPORT AND                                                          FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2018    ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)    FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018    1. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)  (i) Intangible assets – Computer software          Intangible assets comprise of computer software costs which are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any        impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost of computer software on a straight line basis over        its estimated useful life of five years.    (j) Investment properties          Investment properties comprises land and buildings held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation. They are        carried at fair value, determined at the reporting date by valuation experts with experience and knowledge of the        locations where the properties are located. Fair value is based on active market prices as adjusted, if necessary, for        any difference in the nature, condition or location of the specific asset.        Investment properties are not subject to depreciation. Changes in their carrying amount between end of reporting        periods are dealt with, through profit or loss for the year. Upon disposal of an investment property, the difference        between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount is charged or credited to profit or loss for the year.    (k) Financial instruments          From 1 January 2018, the Company classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:        •	 Those to be measured subsequently at fair value through either OCI or through profit or loss, and        •	 Those to be measured at amortised cost.        The classification depends on the Company’s business model for managing the financial assets and the collateral terms        of the cash flows        For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will be recorded in profit or loss. For investments in unquoted        equity instruments that are not held for trading, the Company has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial        recognition to account for them at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).        The Company reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.         (i) Recognition and derecognition          Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date, the date on which the Company        commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the        investments have expired or have been transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards        of ownership.         (ii) Measurement          At initial recognition, the Company measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not        at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the        financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or        loss.         Debt instruments          Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Company’s business model for managing the asset and        the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are two measurement categories into which the Company classifies its        debt instruments:        •	 Amortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely              payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is            included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is            recognised directly in profit or loss and presented in other gains/ (losses) together with foreign exchange gains and            losses. Impairment losses are presented as separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.    40","ANNUAL REPORT AND                                       FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2018    ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)    FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018    1. Summary of Significant accounting policies (continued)    (k) Financial instruments (continued)        (ii) Measurement (continued)        Debt instruments (continued)         FVTPL: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost are measured at FVTPL. A gain or loss on a debt       investment that is subsequently measured at FVTPL is recognised in profit or loss.        Equity instruments         The Company subsequently measures quoted equity investments at fair value. Changes in the fair value of financial       assets at FVTPL are recognised in other gains/ (losses) in the statement of profit or loss as applicable.       The Company’s subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, except where the       Company’s management has elected, at initial recognition, to irrevocably designate an equity investment at fair value       through other comprehensive income. The Companys policy is to designate equity investments as FVOCI when those       investments are held for purposes other than to generate investment returns. When this election is used, fair value gains       and losses are recognised in OCI and are subsequently reclassified to profit or loss, including on disposal. Impairment       losses (and reversals of impairment losses) are not reported separately from other changes in fair values. Dividends,       when representing a return on such investments, continue to be recognised in profit or loss as other income when the       Company’s right to receive payment is established.       Gains and losses on equity investments at FVPL are included in the “Net trading income” line in the statement of profit       or loss        (iii) Determination of fair value         For financial instruments traded in active markets, the determination of fair values of financial assets and financial       liabilities is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly       transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This includes listed equity securities and quoted       debt instruments on major exchanges (NSE). The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Company       is the current bid price.       A financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available       from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual       and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. If the above criteria are not met, the market is       regarded as being inactive.       For example, a market is inactive when there is a wide bid-offer spread or significant increase in the bid-offer spread       or there are few recent transactions.       For all other financial instruments, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. In these techniques, fair values       are estimated from observable data in respect of similar financial instruments, using models to estimate the present       value of expected future cash flows or other valuation techniques, using inputs existing at the dates of the statement       of financial position.       Fair values are categorised into three levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the degree to which the inputs to the       measurement are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety:       •	 Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical             assets or liabilities.       •	 Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1             that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).       •	 Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or             liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).       Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognised by the Company at the end of the reporting period       during which the change occurred.                                                                      41","ANNUAL REPORT AND                                                          FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2018    ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)    FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018    1. Summary of Significant accounting policies (continued)    (k) Financial instruments (continued)       (iv) Impairment          From 1 January 2018, the Company assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its        debt instruments carried at amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been        a significant increase in credit risk.        Prior to 1 January 2018, the Company would assess at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that        a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired and        impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that        have occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on        the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.        Objective evidence that a financial asset or group of assets is impaired includes observable data that comes to the        attention of the Company about the following events:        •	 significant financial difficulty of the issuer or debtor        •	 a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in payments        •	 it becoming probable that the issuer or debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation        •	 the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties; or        •	 observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flow from a group of              financial assets since the initial recognition of those assets, although the decrease cannot yet be identified with the            individual financial assets in the Company, including:        •	 An adverse change in the payment status of issuers or debtors in the Company; or        •	 National or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on the assets in the Company.        IFRS 9 replaced the previous ‘incurred loss’ model in IAS 39 with a forward-looking ‘expected credit loss’ (“ECL”) model.        The new impairment model applies to the following financial instruments that are not measured at FVTPL or FVTOCI:        •	 Government securities measured at amortised cost        •	 Receivables arising from reinsurance arrangements        •	 Other receivables.        •	 Loans receivable        •	 Corporate bonds and commercial paper;        •	 Deposits with financial institutions; and        •	 Cash and bank balances.        No impairment loss is recognised on equity investments and financial assets measured at FVTPL. The Company recognises        loss allowance at an amount equal to either 12-month ECLs or lifetime ECLs. Lifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from        all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument, whereas 12-month ECLs are the portion of        ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date.        The Company will recognise loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except in the following cases, for        which the amount recognised will be 12-month ECLs:        •	 Debt instruments that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date. The Company will consider a            debt instrument to have low credit risk when its credit risk rating is equivalent to the globally understood definition            of ‘investment-grade’ and investments in Government securities; and        •	 Other financial instruments (other than trade receivables) for which credit risk has not increased significantly since            initial recognition.        Loss allowances for receivables arising from reinsurance arrangements and other receivables will always be measured at        an amount equal to lifetime ECLs. The impairment requirements of IFRS 9 require management judgement, estimates        and assumptions, particularly in the following areas, which are discussed in detail below:        •	 assessing whether the credit risk of an instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition; and            Incorporating forward-looking information into the measurement of ECLs.    42","ANNUAL REPORT AND                                       FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2018    ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)    FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018    1. Summary of Significant accounting policies (continued)  (k) Financial instruments (continued)        (iv) Impairment (continued)      Measurement of expected credit losses         ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses and will be measured as follows:       •	 Financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date: the present value of all cash shortfalls – i.e. the             difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the           Company expects to receive;       •	 Financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date: the difference between the gross carrying amount           and the present value of estimated future cash flows;       An asset is credit-impaired if one or more events have occurred that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future       cash flows of the asset. The following are examples of such events:       i. Significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower;       ii. A breach of contract - e.g. a default or past-due event;       iii. A lender having granted a concession to the borrower - for economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower’s            financial difficulty - that the lender would not otherwise consider;       iv. It becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation;       v. The disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties; or       vi. The purchase of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses.        Expected credit losses         Expected credit losses are computed as a product of the Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and the       Exposure at Default (EAD).       ECL = PD x LGD x EAD       In applying the IFRS 9 impairment requirements, the Company follows the general approach method.        Definition of the general approach         Under the general approach, at each reporting date, the Group determines whether the financial asset is in one of three       stages in order to determine both the amount of ECL to recognise as well as how interest income should be recognised.       •	 Stage 1 - where credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition. For financial assets in stage 1, the             Group will recognise 12 month ECL and recognise interest income on a gross basis – this means that interest will be           calculated on the gross carrying amount of the financial asset before adjusting for ECL.       •	 Stage 2 - where credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition. When a financial asset transfers to           stage 2, the Group will recognise lifetime ECL but interest income will continue to be recognised on a gross basis.       •	 Stage 3 - where the financial asset is credit impaired. This is effectively the point at which there has been an           incurred loss event. For financial assets in stage 3, the Group will continue to recognise lifetime ECL but they will           now recognise interest income on a net basis. As such, interest income will be calculated based on the gross carrying           amount of the financial asset less ECL.       The changes in the loss allowance balance are recognised in profit or loss as an impairment gain or loss.                                                                      43","ANNUAL REPORT AND                                                          FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2018    ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)    FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018    1. Summary of Significant accounting policies (continued)  (k) Financial instruments (continued)         (iv) Impairment (continued)       Definition of default          The Company will consider a financial asset to be in default when:        •	 The counterparty or borrower is unlikely to pay their credit obligations to the Company in full, without recourse by              the Company to actions such as realising security (if any is held); or        •	 The counterparty or borrower is more than 90 days past due on any material credit obligation to the Company and 2              years for receivables arising form reinsurance arrangements. This will be consistent with the rebuttable criteria set            out by IFRS 9 and existing practice of the Company; or        •	 In assessing whether the counterparty or borrower is in default, the Company considers indicators that are:        •	 Qualitative: e.g. Breach of covenant and other indicators of financial distress;        •	 Quantitative: eg. Overdue status and non-payment of another obligation of the same issuer to the Company; and        •	 Based on data developed internally and obtained from external sources.        Inputs into the assessment of whether a financial instrument is in default and their significance may vary over time         to reflect changes in circumstances to reflect changes in circumstances.         Significant increase in credit risk (SIICR)          When determining whether the credit risk (i.e. risk of default) on a financial instrument has increased significantly        since initial recognition, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available        without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis based on the        Group’s historical experience, expert credit assessment and forward-looking information.        The Company primarily identifies whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred for an exposure by comparing:        •	 The remaining lifetime probability of default (PD) as at the reporting date; with        •	 The remaining lifetime PD for this point in time that was estimated on initial recognition of the exposure.        The assessment of significant deterioration is key in establishing the point of switching between the requirement to        measure an allowance based on 12-month expected credit losses and one that is based on lifetime expected credit        losses.        The Company monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify significant increases in credit risk by regular        reviews to confirm that:        •	 the criteria are capable of identifying significant increases in credit risk before an exposure is in default;        •	 the criteria do not align with the point in time when an asset becomes 30 days past due;        •	 the average time between the identification of a significant increase in credit risk and default appears reasonable;        •	 exposures are not generally transferred from 12-month ECL measurement to credit-impaired; and        •	 there is no unwarranted volatility in loss allowance from transfers between 12-month and lifetime ECL measurements.    44","ANNUAL REPORT AND                                       FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2018    ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)    FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018    1. Summary of Significant accounting policies (continued)    (k) Financial instruments (continued)      Incorporation of forward-looking information         The Company incorporates forward-looking information into both its assessment of whether the credit risk of an       instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition and its measurement of ECL. It formulates a ‘base case’       view of the future direction of relevant economic variables and a representative range of other possible forecast       scenarios based on advice from the Group risk committee and economic experts and consideration of a variety of       external actual and forecast information. This process involves developing two or more additional economic scenarios       and considering the relative probabilities of each outcome. External information includes economic data and forecasts       published by governmental bodies and monetary authorities in the countries where the company operates, supranational       organisations such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the International Monetary       Fund, and selected private-sector and academic forecasters.       The base case represents a best estimate and is aligned with information used by the Company for other purposes, such       as strategic planning and budgeting. The other scenarios represent more optimistic and more pessimistic outcomes.       The Company also periodically carries out stress-testing of more extreme shocks to calibrate its determination of these       other representative scenarios.       Measurement of ECL       The key inputs into the measurement of ECL are the term structures of the following variables:       •	 Probability of Default       •	 Loss given default (LGD); and       •	 Exposure at default (EAD).       To determine lifetime and 12-month PDs, the Company uses the PD tables supplied by S&P based on the default history       of obligors with the same credit rating. The Company adopts the same approach for unrated investments by mapping its       internal risk grades to the equivalent external credit ratings. The PDs are recalibrated based on current bond yields and       CDS prices, and adjusted to reflect forward-looking information. Changes in the rating for a counterparty or exposure       lead to a change in the estimate of the associated PD.       LGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default. The Company estimates LGD parameters based on the       history of recovery rates of claims against defaulted counterparties. The LGD models consider the structure, collateral,       seniority of the claim, counterparty industry and recovery costs of any collateral that is integral to the financial asset.       For loans secured by mortgage property, loan-to-¬value ratios are a key parameter in determining LGD. LGD estimates       are recalibrated for different economic scenarios. They are calculated on a discounted cash flow basis using the       effective interest rate as the discounting factor.       EAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Company derives the EAD from the current       exposure to the counterparty and potential changes to the current amount allowed under the contract, including       amortisation, and prepayments. The EAD of a financial asset is its gross carrying amount.       As described above, and subject to using a maximum of a 12-month PD for financial assets for which credit risk has not       significantly increased, the Group measures ECL considering the risk of default over the maximum contractual period       (including any borrower’s extension options) over which it is exposed to credit risk, even if, for risk management       purposes, the Group considers a longer period. Where modelling of a parameter is carried out on a collective basis, the       financial instruments are grouped on the basis of shared risk characteristics, which include:       •	 instrument type;       •	 credit risk grading;       •	 collateral type;       •	 date of initial recognition;       •	 remaining term to maturity; industry; and       •	 geographic location of the borrower.       The groupings are subject to regular review to ensure that exposures within a particular group remain appropriately       homogeneous. When ECL are measured using parameters based on collective modelling, a significant input into the       measurement of ECL is the external benchmark information that the Company uses to derive the default rates of its       portfolios.                                                                                                                                                                       45","ANNUAL REPORT AND                                                          FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2018    ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)    FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018    1. Summary of Significant accounting policies (continued)  (k) Financial instruments (continued)         Accounting policies applied until 31 December 2017          The Company has applied IFRS 9 retrospectively, but has elected not to restate comparative information. As a result,        the comparative information provided continues to be accounted for in accordance with the Company’s previous        accounting policy.         (i) Classification          Until 31 December 2017, the Company classified its financial assets in the following categories:        •	 Loans and receivables,        •	 Held-to-maturity investments, and        •	 Fair value through other comprehensive income        The classification depended on the purpose for which the investments were acquired.        Management determined the classification of its investments at initial recognition and, in the case of assets classified        as held-to-maturity, re-evaluated this designation at the end of each reporting period.         (ii) Reclassification          The Company could choose to reclassify a non-derivative trading financial asset out of the held for trading category if        the financial asset was no longer held for the purpose of selling it in the near term. Financial assets other than loans        and receivables were permitted to be reclassified out of the held for trading category only in rare circumstances arising        from a single event that was unusual and highly unlikely to recur in the near term. In addition, the Company could        choose to reclassify financial assets that would meet the definition of loans and receivables out of the held for trading        category if the Company had the intention and ability to hold these financial assets for the foreseeable future or until        maturity at the date of reclassification.        Reclassifications were made at fair value as of the reclassification date. Fair value became the new cost or amortised        cost as applicable, and no reversals of fair value gains or losses recorded before reclassification date were subsequently        made. Effective interest rates for financial assets reclassified to loans and receivables and held-to-maturity categories        were determined at the reclassification date. Further increases in estimates of cash flows adjusted effective interest        rates prospectively.         (iii) Subsequent measurement          The measurement at initial recognition did not change on adoption of IFRS 9, see description above.        Subsequent to the initial recognition, loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments were carried at amortised        cost using the effective interest method.        Financial assets at FVTPL were subsequently carried at fair value. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value        were recognised in profit or loss within other gains/(losses)         (iv) Impairment          The Company assessed at the end of each reporting period whether there was objective evidence that a financial asset        or group of financial assets was impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets was impaired and impairment        losses were incurred only if there was objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred        after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) had an impact on the estimated        future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that could be reliably estimated.    46","ANNUAL REPORT AND                                                             FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2018    ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)    FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018    1. Summary of Significant accounting policies (continued)    (l) Translation of foreign currencies	    (i) Functional and presentation currency  Items included in the financial statements of each of the Company’s entities are measured using the currency of the  primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the ‘functional currency’).The financial statements are  presented in Kenya shillings rounded to the nearest thousand (“Shs”), which is the Company’s presentation currency.         (ii) Transactions and balances       Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates       of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the       settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities       denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss, except when deferred in other comprehensive       income as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.       Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the       statement of profit or loss within finance income or costs’. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in       the statement of profit or loss within other (losses)/gains.    (m) Accounting for leases         Leases of assets where a significant proportion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the Company       as a lessee are classified as finance leases. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Payments made under       operating leases are charged to profit or loss for the year on the straight-line basis over the term of the lease.    (n) Employee entitlements         Employee entitlements to long service awards are recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made for       the estimated liability for such entitlements as a result of services rendered by employees up to the reporting date.       The estimated monetary liability for employees’ accrued annual leave entitlement at the reporting date is recognised       as an expense accrual.    (o) Income tax expense    Income tax expense is the aggregate amount charged/(credited) in respect of current income tax and deferred income  tax in determining the profit or loss for the year. Tax is recognised in the profit or loss except when it relates to items  recognised in other comprehensive income, in which case it is also recognised in other comprehensive income, or to  items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is also recognised directly in equity.    Current income tax    Current income tax is the amount of income tax payable on the taxable profit for the year, and any adjustment  to tax  payable in respect of prior years, determined in accordance with the Kenyan Income Tax Act.    Deferred income tax asset    Deferred income tax is provided in full on all temporary differences except those arising on the initial recognition of an  asset or liability, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither the accounting  nor taxable profit nor loss. Deferred income tax is determined using the liability method on all temporary differences  arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes, using  tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and expected to apply when the related  deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred tax liability is settled.  Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be  available against which temporary differences can be utilized.                                                                                                                   47","ANNUAL REPORT AND                                                          FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2018    ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)    FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018    1. Summary of Significant accounting policies (continued)  (p) Retirement benefit obligations          The Company operates a defined contribution scheme for its employees. The assets of the scheme are held in a separate        trustee administered fund, which is funded from contributions from both the Company and employees. Contributions        are determined by the rules of the scheme.        The Company also contributes to the statutory defined contribution pension scheme, the National Social Security Fund        (NSSF). Contributions to this scheme are determined by local statute. The Company’s obligations to these schemes are        charged to profit or loss in the year they fall due.    (q) Dividend distribution          Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the year        in which the dividends are approved by the shareholders.    (r) Share capital          Ordinary shares are recognised at par value and classified as ‘share capital’ in equity. Any amounts received over and        above the par value of the shares issued are classified as ‘share premium’ in equity.        Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction,        net of tax, from the proceeds.        Shares are classified as equity when there is no obligation to transfer cash or other assets.

(t) Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty          In the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies, management has made estimates and assumptions that        affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Estimates and judgments are        continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events        that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.         (i) Critical judgments in applying the Company’s accounting policies          The key areas of judgment in applying the Company’s accounting policies are dealt with as follows:        Future benefit payments from long-term insurance contracts        The estimation of future benefit payments from long-term insurance contracts is one of the Company’s most critical        accounting estimates. There are several sources of uncertainty that need to be considered in the estimate of the        liability that the Company will ultimately pay for such claims.        The determination of the liabilities under long-term insurance contracts is dependent on estimates made by the        Company. Estimates are made as to the expected number of deaths for each of the years in which the Company is        exposed to risk. The Company bases these estimates on standard mortality tables that reflect historical mortality        experience. The estimated number of deaths determines the value of the benefit payments and the value of the        valuation premiums. The main source of uncertainty is that epidemics such as AIDS could result in future mortality        being significantly worse than in the past for the age Company’s in which the Company has significant exposure to        mortality risk.    48","ANNUAL REPORT AND                                       FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2018    ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)    FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018    1. Summary of Significant accounting policies (continued)      (i) Critical judgments in applying the Company’s accounting policies (continued)         Future benefit payments from long-term insurance contracts (continued)       However, continuing improvements in medical care and social conditions could result in improvements in longevity in       excess of those allowed for in the estimates used to determine the liability for contracts where the Company is exposed       to longevity risk. For contracts without fixed terms and with discretionary participation in profits, it is assumed that       the Company will be able to increase mortality risk charges in future years in line with emerging mortality experience.       Estimates are also made as to future investment income arising from the assets backing long-term insurance contracts.       These estimates are based on current market returns as well as expectations about future economic and financial       developments. The average estimated rate of investment return is 11.83%p.a. (2017: 11.50% p.a)         Valuation of investment property       Estimates are made in determining valuations of investment properties. The management uses experts in determination       of the values to adopt. In performing the valuation the valuer uses discounted cash flow projections which incorporate       assumptions around the continued demand for rental space, sustainability of growth in rent rates as well as makes       reference to recent sales. The independent valuers also use the highest and best use principle in determining the value       of Investment property. The change in these assumptions could result in a significant change in the canying value of       investment property.       Management monitors the investment property market and economic conditions that may lead to significant change in       fair value and conducts a formal and independent property valuation every year and adjusts the recorded fair values       accordingly for any significant change.         Calculation of loss allowances       The measurement of the expected credit loss allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI is an       area that requires the use of complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit       behaviour (e.g. the likelihood of customers defaulting and the resulting losses).        Key sources of estimation uncertainty         Impairment losses       At the reporting date, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine       whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the       recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. Where it is not       possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of       the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.       A number of significant judgements are also required in applying the accounting requirements for measuring ECL, such       as:       •	 Determining the criteria for significant increase in credit risk;       •	 Choosing appropriate models and assumptions for the measurement of ECL;       •	 Establishing the number and relative weightings for a forward-looking scenarios for each type of product / market             and associated ECL; and       •	 Establishing groups of similar assets for the purposes of measuring ECL.       If the PD rates on the financial assets had been 5% higher or lower as at 31 December 2018, the loss allowance would       have been Shs 0.4 million higher/lower.

The address of its registered office is 07 Apollo Centre, Ring Road Parklands, Westlands, Nairobi.    2 RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES          The Company’s activities expose it to a variety of risks, including insurance risk, financial risk, credit risk, and the        effects of changes in property values, debt and equity market prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest        rates. The Company’s overall risk management programme focuses on the identification and management of risks and        seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on its financial performance, by use of underwriting guidelines and capacity        limits, reinsurance planning, credit policy governing the acceptance of clients, and defined criteria for the approval        of intermediaries and reinsurers. Investment policies are in place which help manage liquidity, and seek to maximize        return within an acceptable level of interest rate risk. The Company manages key risks as follows:         2.1 1nsurance risk management          The risk under any one insurance contract is the possibility that the insured event occurs and the uncertainty of        the amount of the resulting claim. By the very nature of an insurance contract, this risk is random and therefore        unpredictable.        For a portfolio of insurance contracts where the theory of probability is applied to pricing and provisioning, the        principal risk that the Company faces under its insurance contracts is that the actual claims and benefit payments        exceed the carrying amount of the insurance liabilities. This could occur because the frequency or severity of claims        and benefits are greater than estimated. Insurance events are random and the actual number and amount of claims        and benefits will vary from year to year from the level established using statistical techniques. Experience shows that        the larger the portfolio of similar insurance contracts, the smaller the relative variability of the expected outcome will        be. In addition, a more diversified portfolio is less likely to be affected across the board by a change in any subset of        the portfolio.        The Company has developed its insurance underwriting and investment strategy to diversify the type of risks accepted        and within each of these categories to achieve a sufficiently large population of risks to reduce the variability of the        expected outcome. Factors that aggravate insurance risk include lack of risk diversification in terms of type and amount        of risk, geographical, local and type of industry covered.        The Company’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to        minimize potential adverse effects on the Company’s financial performance. It manages these positions within an asset-        liability management (ALM) framework that has been developed to achieve investment returns in excess of obligations        under insurance contracts. The Company produces regular reports at portfolio, legal entity and asset and liability class        level that are circulated to the Company’s key management personnel. The principal technique of the Company’s ALM        framework is to match assets to the liabilities arising from insurance contracts by reference to the type of benefits        payable to contract holders. Separate portfolios of assets are maintained for with-profit business, non-linked non-profit        business, and unit-linked business. For the purposes of the ALM framework, the Company does not manage the fund        for future appropriations as a liability. The Company’s ALM is also integrated with the management of the financial        risks associated with the Company’s other financial assets and liabilities not directly associated with insurance and        investment liabilities. The Company does not use hedge accounting.        The Company has not changed the processes used to manage its risks from previous periods. The notes below explain        how insurance risks are managed using the categories utilized in the Company’s ALM framework.        Under certain contracts, the Company has offered guaranteed annuity options. In determining the value of these        options, estimates have been made as to the percentage of contract holders that will exercise them.

For contracts where survival       is the insured risk, the most significant factor is continued improvement in medical science and social conditions that       would increase longevity.       At present, these risks do not vary significantly in relation to the location of the risk insured by the Company. However,       undue concentration by amounts could have an impact on the severity of benefit payments on a portfolio basis.       The table below presents the concentration of insured benefits across five bands of insured benefits per individual life       assured. The benefit insured figures are shown gross and net of the reinsurance contracts described above. At year-end,       none of these insurance contracts had triggered a recovery under the reinsurance held by the Company.       These tables do not include annuity contracts, for which a separate analysis is reported further below.

In particular, the key financial risk is that the       proceeds from financial assets are not sufficient to fund the obligations arising from insurance policies and investment       contracts as they fall due. The most important components of this financial risk are market risk (including interest rate       risk, equity price risk and currency risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.       These risks arise from open positions in interest rate, currency and equity products, all of which are exposed to general       and specific market movements. The risks that the Company primarily faces due to the nature of its investments and       liabilities are interest rate risk and equity price risk.        (a) Market risks         (i) Interest rate risk       Interest rate risk arises primarily from investments in fixed interest securities. In addition to the extent that claims       costs are related to interest rates, liabilities to policyholders are exposed to interest rate risk. Insurance and non-       profit investment contracts have benefit payments that are fixed and guaranteed at the inception of the contract. The       financial component of these benefits is usually a guaranteed fixed interest rate (for the insurance contracts, this rate       may apply to maturity and/or death benefits) and hence the company’s primary financial risk on these contracts is the       risk that interest income and capital redemptions from the financial assets backing the liabilities are insufficient to       fund the guaranteed benefits payable.       The Company monitors interest rate risk by calculating the mean duration of the investment portfolio and of the liabilities       to policyholders under insurance and investment contracts. The mean duration is an indicator of the sensitivity of the       assets and liabilities to changes in current interest rates. The mean duration of the liabilities is determined by means       of projecting expected cash flows from the contracts using best estimates of mortality and voluntary terminations.       This is calculated in a consistent manner with the prior year. Any gap between the mean duration of the assets and       the estimated mean duration of the liabilities is minimised by means of buying and selling fixed interest securities of       different durations.       The sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk illustrates how changes in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial       instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates at the reporting date. For the guaranteed element       of liabilities under with-profits contracts, changes in interest rate will not cause a change to the amount of the liability       because their carrying amounts are not affected by the level of market interest rates. However, the with profits       element of the liabilities is directly affected by changes in the level of interest rates to the extent that they affect the       carrying amount of the assets held in the with-profits funds.       The Company’s management monitors the sensitivity of reported interest rate movements on a monthly basis by       assessing the expected changes in the different portfolios.       Interest bearing securities represent 92% (2017: 95%) of total investments. If interest rates in market indices had       increased / decreased by a further 5%, with all other variables held constant, and all the company’s investments moving       according to the historical correlation with the index, income would increase / decrease by Shs 227.3 million (2017:       Shs 194 million).         (ii) Equity price risk       The Company is exposed to equity securities price risk as a result of its holdings in equity investments, classified as       financial assets available for sale. Exposures to individual companies and to equity shares in aggregate are monitored in       order to ensure compliance with the relevant regulatory limits for solvency purposes. Investments held are listed and       traded on the Nairobi Stock Exchange.                                                                                                                                                                       55","ANNUAL REPORT AND                                                          FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2018    NOTES TO THE  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)    FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018  2 RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (continued)         2.2 Financial risk management (continued)          (ii)	 Equity price risk (continued)        The Company has a defined investment policy which sets limits on the Company’s exposure to equities both in aggregate        terms and by geography, industry and counterparty. This policy of diversification is used to manage the company’s        price risk arising from its investments in equity securities. Investment management meetings are held daily. At these        meetings, senior investment managers meet to discuss investment return and concentration across the company.        The sensitivity analysis for equity risk illustrates how changes in the fair value of equity securities will fluctuate because        of changes to market prices, whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual equity issuer, or        factors affecting all similar equity securities traded in the market.        Listed equities securities represent 97% (2017: 96%) of total equity investments. If equity market indices had increased        / decreased by a further 5%, with all other variables held constant, and all the company’s equity investments moving        according to the historical correlation with the index, equity would increase / decrease by Shs 11.1 million (2017: Shs        9.7 million).        (iii)	 Currency risk        Foreign currency exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets and liabilities are        denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency. The Company primarily transacts in the Kenya        shilling and its assets and liabilities are denominated in the same currency. The company is therefore not exposed to        currency risk.         (b)	 Credit risk          Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due. Key areas where the company        is exposed to credit risk are:        •	 reinsurers’ share of insurance liabilities and reserves;        •	 amounts due from reinsurers in respect of claims already paid;        •	 amounts due from insurance contract holders;        •	 amounts due from insurance intermediaries;        •	 amounts due from corporate bond issuers and        •	 amount held with financial institutions - under cash and cash equivalents        The Company manages the levels of credit risk it accepts by placing limits on its exposure to a single counterparty, or        companies of counterparties and to geographical and industry segments. Such risks are subject to regular review. Limits        on the level of credit risk by category and territory are approved quarterly by the board of directors.        Reinsurance is used to manage insurance risk. This does not, however, discharge the Company of its liability as the        primary insurer. If a reinsurer fails to pay a claim, the company remains liable for the payment to the policyholder.        The creditworthiness of reinsurers is considered on an annual basis by reviewing their financial strength prior to        finalization of any contract. In addition, management assesses the creditworthiness of all reinsurers and intermediaries        by reviewing credit grades provided by rating agencies and other publicly available financial information. The recent        payment history of reinsurers is also used to update the reinsurance purchasing strategy.    56","ANNUAL REPORT AND                                                                               FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2018    NOTES TO THE  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)    FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018    2 RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (continued)    2.2 Financial risk management (continued)    (b)	 Credit risk (continued)    Management information reported to the directors include details of provisions for impairment on receivables and  subsequent write offs. Internal audit makes regular reviews to assess the degree of compliance with the company’s  procedures on credit. Exposures to individual policyholders and groups of policyholders are within the ongoing monitoring  of the controls associated with regulatory solvency. Where there exists significant exposure to individual policyholders  or homogenous groups of policyholders, a financial analysis is carried out by the management. The Company’s assets  bearing credit risk are summarized below:    Investment in unit link           Gross carrying        Provision of          Net of impair-                  2017  Government securities                     amounts       Impairments          ment provision               Shs ‘000  Reinsurers share of insurance                  2018  liabilities                               Shs ‘000                2018                     2018               15,729  Receivables arising from direct                11,257        Shs ‘000                 Shs ‘000            3,276,180  insurance arrangements                     3,316,404  Life policy & other loans                                                 -                11,257           124,546  Other receivables                            104,662             (2,546)               3,313,858  Corporate bonds and                                                                                           75,358  commercial paper                             120,046                (780)                 103,882  Deposits with financial                                                                                        2,240  institutions                                   11,322   (10,223)             109,823                          44,450  Cash and bank                                  60,923  Total assets bearing credit risk                             (10)             11,312                        185,116                                               185,499              -           60,923                                                                                                              423,327                                             1,040,373        (644)            184,855                                                                                                                21,492                                                 65,216    (8,532)             1,031,841                    4,168,438                                             4,915,702                                                               (65)                65,151                                                          (22,800)             4,892,902    The concentration of credit risk is substantially unchanged compared to prior year. No credit limits were exceeded  during the period. The amounts that are past due and not impaired are as shown below:    Receivables arising from direct insurance arrangements                       109,823                      75,358  Life policy & other loans                                                     11,012                       2,240  Other receivables                                                             60,923                                                                                                            44,450    Total assets past due but not impaired                                       181,758                      122,048    The assets reported above include Shs 11.3 million (2017: Shs 15.7 million) related to the assets backing unit linked  contracts. The holders of these contracts bear the credit risk arising from these assets. The assets above also include  assets held in the with-profits funds where the company is able to transfer part of the credit risk arising from these  assets to holders of with-profits investment and insurance contracts to the extent that the future level of discretionary  bonuses can be reduced to absorb any associated credit losses (as well as losses arising from all other financial risks).  During the year, there was no financial assets that were impaired.    (c) Liquidity risk    Liquidity risk is the risk that cash may not be available at a reasonable cost to pay obligations as they fall due. The  primary liquidity risk of the Company is the obligation to pay claims to policyholders as they fall due. The projected  settlement of these liabilities is modelled, on a regular basis, using actuarial techniques. The board sets limits on the  minimum proportion of maturing funds available to meet such calls and on the minimum level of borrowing facilities  that should be in place to cover anticipated liabilities and unexpected levels of demand.                                                                                                              57","ANNUAL REPORT AND      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2018    NOTES TO THE  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)    FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018    2 RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (continued)        2.2 Financial risk management (continued)        (c) Liquidity risk (continued)        The table below provides the contractual maturity analysis of the Company’s financial liabilities at 31 December 2018:                                                          No stated   Less than More than       Total                                                         maturity   1 year      1 year      Sh’000                                                             Sh’000   Sh’000      Sh’000        Insurance contract liabilities                        20,000  310,968     708,738     1,039,706       Payables under deposit insurance contracts        3,497,314            -           -  3,497,314      Payables arising out of reinsurance arrangements                       -           -      Other payables                                        86,482           -           -      86,482                                                          124,614                             124,614        The table below provides a contractual maturity analysis of the company’s financial liabilities as at 31      December 2017:                                                          No stated   Less than More than       Total                                                         maturity   1 year      1 year      Sh’000                                                             Sh’000   Sh’000      Sh’000        Insurance contract liabilities                        35,000  187,111     762,689       984,800      Payables under deposit insurance contracts        3,115,339            -           -  3,115,339      Payables arising out of reinsurance arrangements                       -           -      Other payables                                        22,297           -           -      22,297                                                          103,952                             103,952        (d) Unit-linked contracts        For unit-linked contracts, the Company matches all the liabilities with assets in the portfolio in which the unit prices      are based.

The different levels have      been defined as follows:      •	 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1).      •	 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly            (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2).      •	 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (Level 3).    58","ANNUAL REPORT AND                                                                    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2018    NOTES TO THE  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)    FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018    2 RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (continued)    2.3 Fair value hierarchy (continued)    The following table presents the company’s financial assets measured at fair value at 31 December 2017 and  31 December 2018    31 December 2018                      Level 1       Level 2       Level 3                            Total  Fair value through profit and loss    Shs’000       Shs’000       Shs’000                        Shs’000  - Government securities  - Quoted equities                      770,804                 -             -                     770,804  - Unquoted equities                    222,700                 -             -                     222,700  Total                                                   7,557                -                                                   -      7,557                -                        7,557                                        993,504                                                  1,001,061    31 December 2017                       658,058                -   - 658,058  Available for sale                     195,119                -   - 195,119  - Government securities                                8,970      - 8,970  - Quoted equities                               -      8,970      - 862,147  - Unquoted equities                   853,177  Total    There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the year.  The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet  date. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer,  broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring  market transactions on an arm’s length basis. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the company  is the current bid price. These instruments are included in level 1. Instruments included in level 1 comprise primarily  Nairobi Securities Exchange (“NSE”) equity investments and government bonds classified as available for sale.  The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives)  is determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data  where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair  value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.  If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.  Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include  •	 Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments  •	 The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on        observable yield curves.  •	 The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the balance        sheet date, with the resulting value discounted back to present value.  Other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial  instruments.  There was no movement in level 3 during the year.                                                                                                   59","ANNUAL REPORT AND         FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2018    NOTES TO THE  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)    FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018    2 RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (continued)    The following table presents the company’s financial assets and liabilities classified under various categories, measured  and carried at fair value at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2018.

The Company is subject to a number of regulatory capital tests and also employ a number of realistic tests to allocate       capital and manage risk.       In reporting the Company’s financial strength, capital and solvency is measured using the regulations prescribed by the       Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA). These regulatory capital tests are based upon required levels of solvency capital       and a series of prudent assumptions in respect of the type of business written by the company.       The Company’s objectives in managing its capital are:       •	 to match the profile of its assets and liabilities, taking account of the risks inherent in the business;       •	 to maintain financial strength to support business growth;       •	 to satisfy the requirements of its policyholders, regulators and rating agencies;       •	 to retain financial flexibility by maintaining strong liquidity and access to a range of capital markets;       •	 to allocate capital efficiently to support growth; and       •	 to manage exposures to movement in exchange rate         An important aspect of the Company’s overall capital management process is the setting of target risk-adjusted rates       of return for individual business units, which are aligned to performance objectives and ensure that the Company is       focused on the creation of value for shareholders.       The Company has a number of sources of capital available to it and seeks to optimise its debt to equity structure       in order to ensure that it can consistently maximise returns to shareholders. The Company considers not only the       traditional sources of capital funding but the alternative sources of capital including reinsurance, as appropriate, when       assessing its deployment and usage of capital. The Company manages as capital all items that are eligible to be treated       as capital for regulatory purposes.       The Company is regulated by the Insurance Regulatory Authority in Kenya and as such, is subject to insurance solvency       regulations which specify the minimum amount and type of capital that must be held in addition to the insurance       liabilities.       The Kenya Insurance regulatory authority has also introduced Risk Based Capital model which will result in risk based       approach to supervision. In line with risk based methodology, IRA has developed a Risk Based Capital (RBC) model,       which is aimed at introducing capital requirements that are commensurate to the levels of risk being undertaken, and       provide appropriate incentives for good risk management. The RBC model is a factor based model that computes the       capital requirement based on four risk segments: insurance, market, credit and operational risk.       The new capital requirement (Risk Based Capital) were introduced in the Finance Act, 2015. Insurance companies are       required to hold paid up capital by the 30th June 2020; the higher of:-       i. Shs 400 million; or       ii. risk based capital determined by the Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA) from time to time; or       iii. 5% of the liabilities of the life business for the financial year.                                                                                                                                                                       61","ANNUAL REPORT AND              FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2018    NOTES TO THE  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)    FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018    2 RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (continued)        2.4 Capital risk management (continued)        The Capital Adequacy ratio of the Company as at 31 December 2018 and 2017 is illustrated below.

Management has assessed the impact if the margin was      reduced to 10%, the profit/surplus would have increased by Shs 60million for the year and the Capital Adequacy Ratio      would have gone up to stand at 147% as at 31 December 2018.

At the reporting date, there was no litigation that the company was aware of. The directors are of      the opinion that any litigation that may arise from this source will not have a material effect on the financial position      or profits of the Company.      In 2015, the Company received a tax assessment for principal tax of Shs 33,745,125 relating to prior periods, which is      in dispute and the company is contesting the assessment. No provision has been made in these financial statements for      these amounts as the Company considers it has adequate grounds to dispute the assessment.    30 OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS         The future minimum lease payments under operating leases are as follows:                                                                                      2018      2017                                                                                 Shs’000   Shs’000     Due not later than 1 year                                                      11,920   11,352   Due after 1 year and not later than 5 years                                    71,779   68,361   Later than 5 years                                                             18,683   17,793      Total                                                                         102,382   97,506    31 RELATED PARTIES    In the normal course of business, insurance policies are sold to related parties at terms and conditions similar to those  offered to major clients.

I never knew retirement would be this fun, 3 years after I   still feel as fresh, young and vibrant. Having always wanted        to make good of all the ideas I had over the years, like     starting a hotel business in my village, I needed a regular   income to be able to fund my dreams. I had enrolled for the     APA Personal Pension plan and they came through for me     in my retirement years giving me the steady income and      being able to enjoy my life.Thank you APA for putting a               smile on my face and insuring my happiness.
