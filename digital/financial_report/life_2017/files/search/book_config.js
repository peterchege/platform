The valuation was conducted in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and in accordance with the     requirements of the Insurance Act Cap 487 of the Laws of Kenya. Those principles require that prudent principles for future     outgo under contracts, generally based upon the assumptions that current conditions will continue. Provision is therefore     not made for all possible contingencies.     In completing the actuarial valuation, I have relied upon the audited financial statements of the Company.

Reasonable assuranceis a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a ma-terial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individuallyor in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis ofthese financial statements.As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticismthroughout the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whetherdue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is suf-ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting fromfraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresen-tations, or the override of internal control.Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate inthe circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclo-sures made by the directors. Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accountingand, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that maycast significant doubt on the ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, weare required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such dis-closures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date ofour auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whetherthe financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and signifi-cant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the auditof the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in ourauditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circum-stances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doingso would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.Report on other matters prescribed by the Kenyan Companies Act, 2015In our opinion the information given in the report of the directors on page 18 is consistent with the financial statements.

It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies. The           areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to           the financial statements are disclosed in note 1 (t).     (b) Changes in accounting policy and disclosures           i) New and amended standards adopted by the Company           	 The following standards and amendments have been applied by the Company for the first time for the financial year              beginning 1 January 2017:           	 Amendments to IAS 7; Effective 1 January 2017, entities will be required to explain changes in their liabilities arising              from financing activities. This includes changes arising from cash flows (e.g. drawdowns and repayments of borrow-              ings) and on cash changes such as acquisitions, disposals, accretion of interest and unrealized exchange differences.              Changes in financial assets must be included in this disclosure if the cash flows were, or will be included in cash flows              from financing activities. This could be the case, for example, for assets that hedge liabilities arising from financing              liabilities.	 Entities may include changes in other items as part of this disclosure, for example, by providing a net debt              reconciliation. However, in this case the changes in other items must be disclosed separately from the changes in li-              abilities arising from financing activities. The information may be disclosed in tabular format as a reconciliation from              opening and closing balances, but a specific format is not mandated.           	           	 Amendments to IAS 12: Income taxes, Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses – effective 1 January              2017. The amendment was issued to clarify the requirements for recognising deferred tax assets on unrealised losses.              The amendment clarifies the accounting for deferred tax where an asset is measured at fair value and that fair value is              below the asset’s tax base. It also clarifies certain other aspects of accounting for deferred tax assets. The amendment              clarifies the existing guidance under IAS 12. It does not change the underlying principles for the recognition of deferred              tax assets.           	 The adoption of these amendments did not have any material impact on the current period or any prior period and is              not likely to affect future periods.           (ii) New standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective for 31 December 2017 year-end           The Company has not applied the following new and revised standards and interpretations that have been published but           are not yet effective for the year beginning 1 January 2017.           •	 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (issued in July 2014) – This standard will replace IAS 39 (and all the previous versions of              IFRS 9) effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. It contains requirements for the classification              and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, impairment, hedge accounting and derecognition:           •	 IFRS 9 requires all recognised financial assets to be subsequently measured at amortised cost or fair value (through              profit or loss or through other comprehensive income), depending on their classification by reference to the business              model within which they are held and their contractual cash flow characteristics.36","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         STATEMENTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2017ACCOUNTINGPOLICIES (continued)    1. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)    b) Changes in accounting policy and disclosures (continued)     (ii) New standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective for 31 December 2017 year-end (continued)     •	 For financial liabilities, the most significant effect of IFRS 9 relates to cases where the fair value option is taken:     	 the amount of change in fair value of a financial liability designated as at fair value through profit or loss that is attrib-        utable to changes in the credit risk of that liability is recognised in other comprehensive income (rather than in profit        or loss), unless this creates an accounting mismatch.     •	 For the impairment of financial assets, IFRS 9 introduces an “expected credit loss” model based on the concept of pro-        viding for expected losses at inception of a contract; it will no longer be necessary for there to be objective evidence        of impairment before a credit loss is recognised.     •	 For hedge accounting, IFRS 9 introduces a substantial overhaul allowing financial statements to better reflect how risk        management activities are undertaken when hedging financial and non¬financial risk exposures.     •	 The derecognition provisions are carried over almost unchanged from IAS 39.     	 APA Life Assurance Limited has done the assessment of IFRS 9’s full impact and expect the following impact on imple-        mentation:     	 The standard will affect the classification and measurement of financial assets held as 1 January 2018 as follows:     •	 Equity investments - the Company holds quoted and unquoted equities as available for sale through other comprehen-        sive income. The intention is to continue to be measured at Fair value though other comprehensive income (FVTOCI).     •	 Government Securities classified as available-for-sale investments carried at fair value are held with a business model        whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows and selling the instruments in the open market. The directors        intention is to continue measuring these instruments at FVTOCI upon the application of IFRS 9,     •	 Government securities, Commercial Paper Corporate Bonds and Life policy loans are held to maturity with a business        model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows by sole payments of principal and interest. The intention is        to measure these at amortised cost under IFRS 9.     •	 Receivables arising out of direct insurance and reinsurance arrangements will continued to be measured at FVTPL un-        der IFRS 9.     	 Financial assets measured at amortized cost under IFRS 9 will be subject to the impairment provision of     	 IFRS 9.     	 The Company will apply the simplified approach to recognize lifetime expected credit losses for its receivables aris-        ing out of direct and reinsurance arrangements and Life policy loans. Government Securities, Deposits with financial        institutions and Commercial papers and corporate bonds are considered to have low credit risk and hence expect to        recognize 12-month expected credit losses for these items.     	 The Company will apply the new rules retrospectively from 1 January 2018. Comparatives for 2017 will not be restated,        the impact of the implementation will be adjusted in the opening retained earnings. Initial assessment shows that im-        pact of impairment charges will be between 4% and 8% of the total value of closing retained earnings as of 31 December        2017.     •	 Amendments to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (issued in September 2016) - The amendments, applicable to annual peri-        ods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, include a temporary exemption from IFRS 9 for insurers that meet specified        criteria and an option for insurers to apply the overlay approach to designated financial assets.     •	 IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (issued in May 2017) - establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presenta-        tion and disclosure of insurance contracts issued. It also requires similar principles to be applied to reinsurance con-        tracts held and investment contracts with discretionary participation features issued. The objective is to ensure that        entities provide relevant information in a way that faithfully represents those contracts     •	 IFRS 16 Leases (issued in January 2016) - The new standard, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 Janu-        ary 2019, introduces a new lessee accounting model, and will require a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all        leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. A lessee will be required to                                                                                                                                                                         37","ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL      STATEMENTS                  2017  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES (continued)         1.

It establishes a single and comprehensive framework for revenue recognition to apply consistently across transactions,              industries and capital markets, with a core principle (based on a five-step model to be applied to all contracts with              customers), enhanced disclosures, and new or improved guidance.           •	 IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for report-              ing useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue              and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains              control of a good or service and thus can direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service. The standard              replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 ‘Construction contracts’ and related interpretations. The standard is effective for              annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and earlier application is permitted. The Company’s main activity              is insurance (underwriting individual life and super annuation) business.           	 Insurance contracts are excluded from the scope of IFRS 15. Consequently, the impact of IFRS 15 to the Company will              not be significant.                       •	 Amendment to IFRS 1 (Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014–2016 Cycle, issued in December 2016) - The amendment,              applicable to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, deletes certain short-term exemptions and removes              certain reliefs for first-time adopters.           •	 Amendments to IAS 40 titled Transfers of Investment Property (issued in December 2016) – The amendments, applicable              to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, clarify that transfers to or from investment property should be              made when, and only when, there is evidence that a change in use of property has occurred.           	 The Directors do not plan to apply any of the above until they become effective. Based on their assessment of the po-              tential impact of application of the above, with the exception of IFRS 9, IFRS 16 and IFRS 17, they do not expect that              there will be a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements. There are no other standards that are not yet              effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the entity in the current or future reporting periods              and on near future transactions           	 There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material              impact on the Company.     (c) Revenue recognition      		           	 For long term insurance business, premiums are recognised as revenue when they become payable by the policyholder.              For single premium business, revenue is recognised on the date on which the policy is effective. Premiums are shown              before deduction of commission.           	 Commissions receivable are recognised as income in the period in which they are earned.           	 Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis that takes into account the effective yield on the asset.           	 Dividends receivable are recognised as income in the period in which the right to receive payment is established.           	 Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.38","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         STATEMENTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2017ACCOUNTINGPOLICIES (continued)1. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)(d) Claims incurred	   	 Claims and policyholders’ benefits payable comprise claims paid in the year and changes in the provision for insurance      contract liabilities. Claims are recorded as an expense when they are incurred. Claims arising on maturing policies are      recognised when the claims becomes due for payment. Death claims are accounted for on notification while surrenders      are accounted for on payment.(e) Deposit administration contracts      The Company administers the funds of a number of retirement benefit schemes. The Company’s liabilities in relation to      these schemes have been treated as payables in the statement of financial position. The liabilities with respect to the      deposit administration contracts are determined by the Consulting Actuary on an annual basis.		(f) Insurance contract liabilities      The Company issues contracts that transfer insurance risk or financial risk or both. Insurance contracts are those con-      tracts that transfer significant insurance risk. Such contracts may also transfer financial risk. As a general guideline, the      Company defines as significant insurance risk the possibility of having to pay benefits on the occurrence of an insured      event that are at least 10% more than the benefits payable if the insured event did occur.      Insurance contract liabilities represent the estimated ultimate cost of settling all claims arising from incidents occurring      prior to the end of the reporting period, but not settled at that date. Insurance contract liabilities are computed on the      basis of the best information available at the time the records for the year are closed, and include provisions for claims      intimated but not paid. Insurance contract liabilities are not discounted.(g) Reinsurance	       The Company assumes and cedes reinsurance in the normal course of business, with retention limits varying by line of       business. Premiums on reinsurance assumed are recognised as income in the same manner as they would be if the rein-       surance were considered direct business. Premiums ceded and claims reimbursed are presented on a gross basis in profit       and loss and statement of financial position as appropriate. Reinsurance assets represent balances due from reinsurance       companies. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the outstanding claims       provision or settled claims associated with the reinsurer’s policies and are in accordance with the related reinsurance       contract.       Impairment occurs when there is objective evidence as a result of an event that occurred after initial recognition of       the reinsurance asset that the Company may not receive all outstanding amounts due under the terms of the contract       and the event has a reliably measurable impact on the amounts that the Company will receive from the reinsurer. The       impairment loss is recognised in the profit or loss.       		       Ceded reinsurance arrangements do not relieve the Company from its obligations to policyholders. The Company also       assumes reinsurance risk in the normal course of business for life insurance and non-life insurance contracts where       applicable.       Reinsurance assets or liabilities are derecognized when the contractual rights are extinguished or expire or when the       contract is transferred to another party. Premiums and claims on assumed reinsurance are recognised as revenue or       expenses in the same manner as they would be if the reinsurance were considered direct business, taking into account       the product classification of the reinsured business. Reinsurance liabilities represent balances due to reinsurance com-       panies. Amounts payable are estimated in a manner consistent with the related reinsurance contract.                                                                                                                                                                         39","ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL      STATEMENTS                  2017    ACCOUNTING    POLICIES (continued)    1. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)    (h) Equipment    		         All equipment are initially recorded at cost less depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. The useful lives         used in determining depreciation charge are:    Computer equipment 	 			  	 3 years    Motor vehicles 	 				                                4 years    Furniture fittings and equipment 			                 8 years    		    The residual values of items of equipment and their estimated useful lives are reviewed at the reporting date and    adjusted if appropriate. Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is    written down immediately to its recoverable amount.    Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are determined by reference to their carrying amounts.    (i) Intangible assets – Computer software         Intangible assets comprise of computer software costs which are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any         impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost of computer software on a straight line basis over its         estimated useful life of five years.    	    (j) Investment properties         Investment properties comprises land and buildings held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation. They are         carried at fair value, determined at the reporting date by valuation experts with experience and knowledge of the lo-         cations where the properties are located. Fair value is based on active market prices as adjusted, if necessary, for any         difference in the nature, condition or location of the specific asset.         Investment properties are not subject to depreciation. Changes in their carrying amount between end of reporting peri-         ods are dealt with, through profit or loss for the year. Upon disposal of an investment property, the difference between         the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount is charged or credited to profit or loss for the year.    		    (k) Financial Instruments    Financial Assets    The Company classifies its financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or    loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity financial assets and available-for-sale financial assets. The classification    adopted for a particular investment depends on the purpose for which the investment was acquired. Management de-    termines the classification of its investments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this at every reporting period end.    i) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”)    This category has two sub-categories: financial assets held for trading and those designated at fair value through profit    or loss at inception. A financial asset is classified into this category at inception if acquired principally for the purpose    of selling in the year, if it forms part of a portfolio of financial assets in which there is evidence of profit-taking or if so    designated by management.    ii) Loans and receivables    Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in    an active market. Receivables arising from insurance contracts are also classified in this category and are reviewed for    impairment as part of the impairment review of loans and receivables.40","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         STATEMENTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2017ACCOUNTINGPOLICIES (continued)1.

Recognition of financial assets     Financial assets are initially recognised cost plus transaction costs. Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets     at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value. Loans and receivables     and held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses     arising from changes in the fair value of “financial assets at fair value through profit or loss” are dealt with in the profit     or loss in the period in which they arise. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale     financial assets are recognised through other comprehensive income and accumulated under a separate heading of fair     value reserve in the statement of changes in equity, until the financial asset is derecognized or impaired, at which time     the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised through other comprehensive income is recognised in the profit or loss     for the year.     Effective interest method     The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest     income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated cash receipts     including all fees, transaction costs and premiums or discounts through the expected life of the financial asset, or, where     appropriate, a shorter period.     Impairment of financial assets     Financial assets, other than those at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each     reporting date. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events     that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have     been impacted.     Objective evidence of impairment for receivables could include the Company’s past experience of collecting payments,     an increase in the number of delayed payments past the average credit period as well as observable changes in national     or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables The carrying amount of the financial asset is re-     duced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying     amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is     written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are recognized as     income in the profit and loss account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit     or loss.     Derecognition of financial assets     The Company derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire;     orit transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If     the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control     the transferred asset, the Company recognizes its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts     it may have to pay. If the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial     asset, the Company continues to recognize the financial asset and also recognizes a collateralized borrowing for the     proceeds received.     Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the company     Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of     the contractual arrangement.                                                                                                                                                                         41","ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL      STATEMENTS                  2017  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES (continued)     1. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)     (k) Financial Instruments (continued)              Classification as debt or equity           	 An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all              of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue              costs.              Financial liabilities           	 Financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs and are sub-              sequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an              effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial lia-              bility and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly              discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate,              a shorter period.              Derecognition of financial liabilities           	 The Company derecognizes financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company’s obligations are discharged, can-              celled or they expire.           Determination of fair value           	 For financial instruments traded in active markets, the determination of fair values of financial assets and financial              liabilities is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly              transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This includes listed equity securities and quoted              debt instruments on major exchange (NSE). The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Company is              the current bid price.           	           	 A financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available              from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual              and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. If the above criteria are not met, the market is              regarded as being inactive.           	 For example a market is inactive when there is a wide bid-offer spread or significant increase in the bid-offer spread              or there are few recent transactions.           	 For all other financial instruments, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. In these techniques, fair              values are estimated from observable data in respect of similar financial instruments, using models to estimate the              present value of expected future cash flows or other valuation techniques, using inputs existing at the dates of the              statement of financial position.           	 Fair values are categorized into three levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the degree to which the inputs to the              measurement are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety:           • Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical              assets or liabilities.           • Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that              are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).           • Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or lia-              bility that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).           Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognised by the Company at the end of the reporting period           during which the change occurred.42","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         STATEMENTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2017ACCOUNTINGPOLICIES (continued)1. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)(l) Translation of foreign currencies     (i) Functional and presentation currency     Items included in the financial statements of each of the Company’s entities are measured using the currency of the     primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the ‘functional currency’).The financial statements are     presented in Kenya shillings rounded to the nearest thousand (“Shs”), which is the Company’s presentation currency.     (ii) Transactions and balances     Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the     dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from     the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabil-     ities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss, except when deferred in other comprehensive     income as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.     Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the state-     ment of profit or loss within finance income or costs’. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the     statement of profit or loss within other (losses)/gains.	(m) Accounting for leases 	 Leases of assets where a significant proportion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the Company as a      lessee are classified as finance leases. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Payments made under oper-      ating leases are charged to profit or loss for the year on the straight-line basis over the term of the lease.	(n) Employee entitlements 	 Employee entitlements to long service awards are recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made for      the estimated liability for such entitlements as a result of services rendered by employees up to the reporting date. The      estimated monetary liability for employees’ accrued annual leave entitlement at the reporting date is recognised as an      expense accrual.	(o) Income tax expense 	 Income tax expense is the aggregate amount charged/(credited) in respect of current income tax and deferred income      tax in determining the profit or loss for the year. Tax is recognised in the profit or loss except when it relates to items      recognised in other comprehensive income, in which case it is also recognised in other comprehensive income, or to      items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is also recognised directly in equity.	     Current income tax 	 Current income tax is the amount of income tax payable on the taxable profit for the year, and any adjustment to tax      payable in respect of prior years, determined in accordance with the Kenyan Income Tax Act.     Deferred income tax asset     	   	 Deferred income tax is provided in full on all temporary differences except those arising on the initial recognition of an       asset or liability, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither the accounting       nor taxable profit nor loss. Deferred income tax is determined using the liability method on all temporary differences       arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes, using       tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and expected to apply when the related       deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred tax liability is settled.   	 Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be       available against which temporary differences can be utilized.                                                                                                                                                                         43","ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL      STATEMENTS                  2017  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES (continued)     1. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)     (p) Retirement benefit obligations         	 The Company operates a defined contribution scheme for its employees. The assets of the scheme are held in a separate            trustee administered fund, which is funded from contributions from both the Company and employees. Contributions            are determined by the rules of the scheme.         	 The Company also contributes to the statutory defined contribution pension scheme, the National Social Security Fund            (NSSF). Contributions to this scheme are determined by local statute. The Company’s obligations to these schemes are            charged to profit or loss in the year they fall due.     (q) Dividend distribution         	 Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the year            in which the dividends are approved by the shareholders.     (r) Share capital        	 Ordinary shares are recognised at par value and classified as ‘share capital’ in equity. Any amounts received over and           above the par value of the shares issued are classified as ‘share premium’ in equity.        	 Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction,           net of tax, from the proceeds.        	 Shares are classified as equity when there is no obligation to transfer cash or other assets.

(t) Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty       	 In the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies, management has made estimates and assumptions that          affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Estimates and judgments are continu-          ally evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are          believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.       	 (i) Critical judgements in applying companies accounting policies          The key areas of judgment in applying the Company’s accounting policies are dealt with as follows:       	 Future benefit payments from long-term insurance contracts       	 The estimation of future benefit payments from long-term insurance contracts is one of the Company’s most critical ac-          counting estimates. There are several sources of uncertainty that need to be considered in the estimate of the liability          that the Company will ultimately pay for such claims.44","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         STATEMENTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2017ACCOUNTINGPOLICIES (continued)1. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) (t) Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)     	 The determination of the liabilities under long-term insurance contracts is dependent on estimates made by the Com-        pany. Estimates are made as to the expected number of deaths for each of the years in which the Company is exposed        to risk. The Company bases these estimates on standard mortality tables that reflect historical mortality experience.        The estimated number of deaths determines the value of the benefit payments and the value of the valuation premi-        ums. The main source of uncertainty is that epidemics such as AIDS could result in future mortality being significantly        worse than in the past for the age Company’s in which the Company has significant exposure to mortality risk.      	 However, continuing improvements in medical care and social conditions could result in improvements in longevity in        excess of those allowed for in the estimates used to determine the liability for contracts where the Company is ex-        posed to longevity risk. For contracts without fixed terms and with discretionary participation in profits, it is assumed        that the Company will be able to increase mortality risk charges in future years in line with emerging mortality expe-        rience. Estimates are also made as to future investment income arising from the assets backing long-term insurance        contracts. These estimates are based on current market returns as well as expectations about future economic and        financial developments. The average estimated rate of investment return is 12.0%p.a. (2015: 12.00% p.a)     	 Held-to-maturity investments        The Company follows the guidance of IAS 39 in classifying non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable        payments and fixed maturity as held-to-maturity. This classification requires significant judgement. In making this        judgement, the company evaluates its intention and ability to hold such investments to maturity. If the Company        fails to hold these investments to maturity other than for the specific circumstances - for example, selling more than        an insignificant amount close to maturity - it will be required to reclassify the entire class as available-for-sale. The        investments would therefore be measured at fair value and not at amortized cost.    	 Key sources of estimation uncertainty     	 Impairment losses     	 At the reporting date, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine        whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the        recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. Where it is not        possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of        the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.

The Company’s overall risk management programme focuses on the identification and management of risks and seeks              to minimize potential adverse effects on its financial performance, by use of underwriting guidelines and capacity              limits, reinsurance planning, credit policy governing the acceptance of clients, and defined criteria for the approval              of intermediaries and reinsurers. Investment policies are in place which help manage liquidity, and seek to maximize              return within an acceptable level of interest rate risk. The Company manages key risks as follows:         2.1 Insurance risk management           	 The risk under any one insurance contract is the possibility that the insured event occurs and the uncertainty of the              amount of the resulting claim. By the very nature of an insurance contract, this risk is random and therefore unpre-              dictable.           	 For a portfolio of insurance contracts where the theory of probability is applied to pricing and provisioning, the prin-              cipal risk that the Company faces under its insurance contracts is that the actual claims and benefit payments exceed              the carrying amount of the insurance liabilities. This could occur because the frequency or severity of claims and              benefits are greater than estimated. Insurance events are random and the actual number and amount of claims and              benefits will vary from year to year from the level established using statistical techniques. Experience shows that the              larger the portfolio of similar insurance contracts, the smaller the relative variability of the expected outcome will be.              In addition, a more diversified portfolio is less likely to be affected across the board by a change in any subset of the              portfolio.           	 The Company has developed its insurance underwriting and investment strategy to diversify the type of risks accept-              ed and within each of these categories to achieve a sufficiently large population of risks to reduce the variability of              the expected outcome. Factors that aggravate insurance risk include lack of risk diversification in terms of type and              amount of risk, geographical, local and type of industry covered.           	 The Company’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks              to minimize potential adverse effects on the Company’s financial performance. It manages these positions within              an asset-liability management (ALM) framework that has been developed to achieve investment returns in excess of              obligations under insurance contracts. The Company produces regular reports at portfolio, legal entity and asset and              liability class level that are circulated to the Company’s key management personnel. The principal technique of the              Company’s ALM framework is to match assets to the liabilities arising from insurance contracts by reference to the              type of benefits payable to contract holders. Separate portfolios of assets are maintained for with-profit business, non-              linked non-profit business, and unit-linked business. For the purposes of the ALM framework, the Company does not              manage the fund for future appropriations as a liability. The Company’s ALM is also integrated with the management              of the financial risks associated with the Company’s other financial assets and liabilities not directly associated with              insurance and investment liabilities. The Company does not use hedge accounting.           	 The Company has not changed the processes used to manage its risks from previous periods. The notes below explain              how insurance risks are managed using the categories utilized in the Company’s ALM framework.48","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                          AND FINANCIAL                                                                          STATEMENTS                                                                          2017NOTES TO THEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)2.1 Insurance risk management (continued)The Company engages in long-term insurance contracts and funds the insurance liabilities with a portfolio of equityand debt securities exposed to market risk.

In particular, the key financial risk is that the proceeds from     financial assets are not sufficient to fund the obligations arising from insurance policies and investment contracts as they fall     due. The most important components of this financial risk are market risk (including interest rate risk, equity price risk and     currency risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.     These risks arise from open positions in interest rate, currency and equity products, all of which are exposed to general and     specific market movements. The risks that the Company primarily faces due to the nature of its investments and liabilities     are interest rate risk and equity price risk.    (a) Market risks    (i) Interest rate risk     Interest rate risk arises primarily from investments in fixed interest securities. In addition to the extent that claims costs are     related to interest rates, liabilities to policyholders are exposed to interest rate risk. Insurance and non-profit investment     contracts have benefit payments that are fixed and guaranteed at the inception of the contract. The financial component of     these benefits is usually a guaranteed fixed interest rate (for the insurance contracts, this rate may apply to maturity and/     or death benefits) and hence the company’s primary financial risk on these contracts is the risk that interest income and     capital redemptions from the financial assets backing the liabilities are insufficient to fund the guaranteed benefits payable.     The Company monitors interest rate risk by calculating the mean duration of the investment portfolio and of the liabilities     to policyholders under insurance and investment contracts. The mean duration is an indicator of the sensitivity of the assets     and liabilities to changes in current interest rates. The mean duration of the liabilities is determined by means of projecting     expected cash flows from the contracts using best estimates of mortality and voluntary terminations. This is calculated in a     consistent manner with the prior year. Any gap between the mean duration of the assets and the estimated mean duration     of the liabilities is minimised by means of buying and selling fixed interest securities of different durations.     The sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk illustrates how changes in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial in-     strument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates at the reporting date. For the guaranteed element of     liabilities under with-profits contracts, changes in interest rate will not cause a change to the amount of the liability because     their carrying amounts are not affected by the level of market interest rates. However the with profits element of the lia-     bilities is directly affected by changes in the level of interest rates to the extent that they affect the carrying amount of the     assets held in the with-profits funds.     The Company’s management monitors the sensitivity of reported interest rate movements on a monthly basis by assessing     the expected changes in the different portfolios.     Interest bearing securities represent 95% (2016: 89%) of total investments. If interest rates in market indices had increased     / decreased by a further 5%, with all other variables held constant, and all the company’s investments moving according     to the historical correlation with the index, income would increase / decrease by Shs 194 million (2016: Shs 149 million).    (ii) Equity price risk     The Company is exposed to equity securities price risk as a result of its holdings in equity investments, classified as financial     assets available for sale. Exposures to individual companies and to equity shares in aggregate are monitored in order to     ensure compliance with the relevant regulatory limits for solvency purposes. Investments held are listed and traded on the     Nairobi Stock Exchange.52","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          STATEMENTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          2017NOTES TO THEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)2 Risk management objectives and policies (continued)2.2 Financial risk management (continued)(a) Market risks (continued)(ii) Equity price risk (continued)The Company has a defined investment policy which sets limits on the Company’s exposure to equities both in aggregateterms and by geography, industry and counterparty. This policy of diversification is used to manage the company’s price riskarising from its investments in equity securities. Investment management meetings are held daily. At these meetings, seniorinvestment managers meet to discuss investment return and concentration across the company.The sensitivity analysis for equity risk illustrates how changes in the fair value of equity securities will fluctuate because ofchanges to market prices, whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual equity issuer, or factorsaffecting all similar equity securities traded in the market.Listed equities securities represent 96% (2016: 97%) of total equity investments. If equity market indices had increased /decreased by a further 5%, with all other variables held constant, and all the company’s equity investments moving accordingto the historical correlation with the index, equity would increase / decrease by Shs 9.7 million (2016: Shs 17.4 million).(iii) Currency riskForeign currency exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets and liabilities are denomi-nated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency. The Company primarily transacts in the Kenya shilling and itsassets and liabilities are denominated in the same currency. The company is therefore not exposed to currency risk.(b) Credit riskCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due. Key areas where the company isexposed to credit risk are:• reinsurers’ share of insurance liabilities and reserves;• amounts due from reinsurers in respect of claims already paid;• amounts due from insurance contract holders;• amounts due from insurance intermediaries;• amounts due from corporate bond issuers and• amount held with financial institutions - under cash and cash equivalentsThe Company manages the levels of credit risk it accepts by placing limits on its exposure to a single counterparty, or com-panies of counterparties and to geographical and industry segments. Such risks are subject to regular review. Limits on thelevel of credit risk by category and territory are approved quarterly by the board of directors.Reinsurance is used to manage insurance risk. This does not, however, discharge the Company of its liability as the primaryinsurer. If a reinsurer fails to pay a claim, the company remains liable for the payment to the policyholder. The creditworthi-ness of reinsurers is considered on an annual basis by reviewing their financial strength prior to finalization of any contract. Inaddition, management assesses the creditworthiness of all reinsurers and intermediaries by reviewing credit grades providedby rating agencies and other publicly available financial information. The recent payment history of reinsurers is also usedto update the reinsurance purchasing strategy.                                                                                                                                                                         53","ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL      STATEMENTS                  2017    NOTES TO THE    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)    2 Risk management objectives and policies (continued)    2.2 Financial risk management (continued)    (b) Credit risk (continued)    Management information reported to the directors include details of provisions for impairment on receivables and subse-    quent write offs. Internal audit makes regular reviews to assess the degree of compliance with the company’s procedures    on credit. Exposures to individual policyholders and groups of policyholders are within the ongoing monitoring of the con-    trols associated with regulatory solvency. Where there exists significant exposure to individual policyholders or homogenous    groups of policyholders, a financial analysis is carried out by the management. The Company’s assets bearing credit risk are    summarized below:                                                            2017                                          2016                                                            Shs ‘000                                      Shs ‘000    Investment in unit trust                                15,729                                        15,209    Government securities                                   3,276,180                                     2,403,059    Reinsurers share of insurance liabilities               124,546                                       73,493    Receivables arising from direct insurance arrangements  75,358                                        49,888    Life policy loans                                       2,240                                         2,055    Other receivables                                       44,450                                        33,070    Corporate bonds and commercial paper                    185,116                                       145,459    Deposits with financial institutions                    423,327                                       448,090    Cash and bank                                           21,492                                        83,313    Total assets bearing credit risk                        4,168,438                                     3,253,636    The concentration of credit risk is substantially unchanged compared to prior year.

The holders of these contracts bear the credit risk arising from these assets. The assets above also include assets held    in the with-profits funds where the company is able to transfer part of the credit risk arising from these assets to holders of    with-profits investment and insurance contracts to the extent that the future level of discretionary bonuses can be reduced    to absorb any associated credit losses (as well as losses arising from all other financial risks). During the year, there was no    financial assets that were impaired.    (c) Liquidity risk    Liquidity risk is the risk that cash may not be available at a reasonable cost to pay obligations as they fall due. The primary    liquidity risk of the Company is the obligation to pay claims to policyholders as they fall due. The projected settlement of    these liabilities is modelled, on a regular basis, using actuarial techniques. The board sets limits on the minimum proportion    of maturing funds available to meet such calls and on the minimum level of borrowing facilities that should be in place to    cover anticipated liabilities and unexpected levels of demand.54","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                                  AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                                  STATEMENTS                                                                                                                  2017NOTES TO THEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)2 Risk management objectives and policies (continued)2.2 Financial risk management (continued)(c) Liquidity risk (continued)The table below provides the contractual maturity analysis of the Company’s financial liabilities at 31 December2017:                                                       No stated   Less than   More than          Total                                                        maturity       1 year       1 year                                                                      Sh’000       Sh’000      Sh’000                                                          Sh’000                                        Insurance contract liabilities                                     187,111     762,689Payables under deposit insurance contracts                 35,000           -           -     984,800Payables arising out of reinsurance arrangements       3,115,339            -           -   3,115,339Other payables                                                              -           -                                                           22,297                               22,297                                                         103,952                              103,952The table below provides a contractual maturity analysis of the company’s financial liabilities as at 31 December 2016:                                                  No stated Less than 1        More than          Total                                                  maturity         year             1 year                                                                                   Sh’000      Sh’000                                                       Sh’000      Sh’000                               Insurance contract liabilities                        35,000       163,489     664,043        862,532Payables under deposit insurance contracts        2,601,453                 -           -   2,601,453Payables arising out of reinsurance arrangements                            -           -Other payables                                        51,437                -           -       51,437                                                      88,116                                    88,116(d) Unit-linked contractsFor unit-linked contracts, the Company matches all the liabilities with assets in the portfolio in which the unit prices arebased.

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.    A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry    group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on    an arm’s length basis. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the company is the current bid price. These    instruments are included in level 1. Instruments included in level 1 comprise primarily Nairobi Securities Exchange (“NSE”)    equity investments and government bonds classified as available for sale.    The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives)    is determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where    it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an    instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.    If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.    Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include    • Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments    • The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on       observable yield curves.    • The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date,       with the resulting value discounted back to present value.    Other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial    instruments. There was no movement in level 3 during the year.56","ANNUAL REPORT                                  AND FINANCIAL                                  STATEMENTS                                  2017NOTES TO THEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)                                  57","ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL      STATEMENTS                  2017 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)    2 Risk management objectives and policies (continued)    2.4 Capital risk management     The Company maintains an efficient capital structure from a combination of equity shareholders’ funds and borrowings,     consistent with the company’s risk profile, the regulatory and market requirements of its business.     The Company is subject to a number of regulatory capital tests and also employ a number of realistic tests to allocate capital     and manage risk.     In reporting the Company’s financial strength, capital and solvency is measured using the regulations prescribed by the In-     surance Regulatory Authority (IRA). These regulatory capital tests are based upon required levels of solvency capital and a     series of prudent assumptions in respect of the type of business written by the company.     The Company’s objectives in managing its capital are:     • to match the profile of its assets and liabilities, taking account of the risks inherent in the business;     • to maintain financial strength to support business growth;     • to satisfy the requirements of its policyholders, regulators and rating agencies;     • to retain financial flexibility by maintaining strong liquidity and access to a range of capital markets;     • to allocate capital efficiently to support growth; and     • to manage exposures to movement in exchange rate     An important aspect of the Company's overall capital management process is the setting of target risk-adjusted rates of     return for individual business units, which are aligned to performance objectives and ensure that the Company is focused on     the creation of value for shareholders.     The Company has a number of sources of capital available to it and seeks to optimise its debt to equity structure in order to     ensure that it can consistently maximise returns to shareholders. The Company considers not only the traditional sources of     capital funding but the alternative sources of capital including reinsurance, as appropriate, when assessing its deployment     and usage of capital. The Company manages as capital all items that are eligible to be treated as capital for regulatory     purposes.     The Company is regulated by the Insurance Regulatory Authority in Kenya and as such, is subject to insurance solvency reg-     ulations which specify the minimum amount and type of capital that must be held in addition to the insurance liabilities.58","ANNUAL REPORT                                                      AND FINANCIAL                                                      STATEMENTS                                                      2017NOTES TO THEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)2 Risk management objectives and policies (continued)2.4 Capital risk management (continued)The Kenya Insurance regulatory authority has also introduced Risk Based Capital model which will result in risk based ap-proach to supervision. In line with risk based methodology, IRA has developed a Risk Based Capital (RBC) model, which isaimed at introducing capital requirements that are commensurate to the levels of risk being undertaken, and provide appro-priate incentives for good risk management. The RBC model is a factor based model that computes the capital requirementbased on four risk segments: insurance, market, credit and operational risk.The new capital requirement (Risk Based Capital) were introduced in the Finance Act, 2015.

The table below analyses the non-financial assets carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have    been defined as follows:    • Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1).    • Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly    (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2).    • Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs)    At 31 December 2017                                      Level 1  Level 2  Level 3           Total                                                             Shs’000  Shs’000  Shs’000       Shs’000    Investment property                                      - 273,000         - 273,000    At 31 December 2016                                      - 313,000         - 313,000    Investment property    Valuation technique used to derive level 2 fair values    Level 2 fair value of land and building has been derived using the sales comparison approach.

At the reporting date, there was no litigation that the company was aware of.
