The valuation was conducted in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and in accordance with the requirements of the     Insurance Act Cap 487 of the Laws of Kenya. Those principles require that prudent principles for future outgo under contracts, generally     based upon the assumptions that current conditions will continue. Provision is therefore not made for all possible contingencies.     In completing the actuarial valuation, I have relied upon the audited financial statements of the company.     In my opinion, the insurer’s insurance liabilities reserves of the company were adequate as at 31 December 2016.

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report but     does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.     Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion     thereon.     In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so,     consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or     otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information, we conclude that there is a     material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.     Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the financial statements     The directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with International Financial     Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Kenyan Companies Act 2015, and for such internal control as the directors determine is     necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.     In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern,     disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend     to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.     The directors are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.     Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements     Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement,     whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but     is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements     can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence     the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.     As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.     We also:        •	 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform            audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our            opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may            involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.        •	 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the            circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.        •	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made            by the directors.        •	 Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence            obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability            to continue as a going concern.     If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the     financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained     up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.        •	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial            statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.        •	 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Company            to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Company            audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.     We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings,     including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.30","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           STATEMENTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        2016REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS TO THEMEMBERS OF APA LIFE ASSURANCE LIMITED (continued)We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, andto communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and whereapplicable, related safeguards.From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Company’sfinancial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.

The financial statements have been        prepared under the historical cost convention, except for investment properties and available-for-sale financial assets which have been        measured at fair value.        The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires        management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree        of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in note 1(s).      Changes in accounting policy and disclosures      (i) New and amended standards adopted by the Company        The following standards and amendments have been applied by the Company for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2016:        Amendments to IAS 1, ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’: The amendments are made in the context of the IASB’s Disclosure Initiative,        which explores how financial statement disclosures can be improved. The amendments, effective 1 January 2016, provide clarifications on        a number of issues, including:        •	 Materiality – an entity should not aggregate or disaggregate information in a manner that obscures useful information. Where items are            material, sufficient information must be provided to explain the impact on the financial position or performance.        •	 Disaggregation and subtotals – line items specified in IAS 1 may need to be disaggregated where this is relevant to an understanding            of the entity’s financial position or performance. There is also new guidance on the use of subtotals.        •	 Notes – confirmation that the notes do not need to be presented in a particular order.        •	 O CI arising from investments accounted for under the equity method – the share of OCI arising from equity-accounted investments is            Company based on whether the items will or will not subsequently be reclassified to profit or loss. Each group should then be presented            as a single line item in the statement of other comprehensive income.        According to the transitional provisions, the disclosures in IAS 8 regarding the adoption of new standards/accounting policies are not        required for these amendments.        The Company has elected to adopt the following two amendments early        Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle. The latest annual improvements, effective 1 January 2016, clarify:        •	 IFRS 7 – specific guidance for transferred financial assets to help management determine whether the terms of a servicing arrangement            constitute ‘continuing involvement’ and, therefore, whether the asset qualifies for de recognition.        •	 FRS 7 – that the additional disclosures relating to the offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities only need to be included in            interim reports if required by IAS 34.        •	 A s these amendments merely clarify the existing requirements, they do not affect the Company’s accounting policies or any of the            disclosures.      (ii) New standards and interpretations not yet adopted        A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January        2016, and have not been applied in preparing these financial statement. None of these is expected to have a significant effect on the        financial statements of the Company, except the following set out below:        IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The        complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of        financial instruments. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories        for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through OCI and fair value through P&L. The basis of classification depends on the entity’s        business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity instruments are required to be        measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in OCI not recycling.        There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities        there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive        income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss.        Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared under IAS 39. The standard is effective for        accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Early adoption is permitted.        The Company is yet to address the impact of IFRS 9.40","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           STATEMENTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        2016ACCOUNTINGPOLICIES (continued)1 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)  Changes in accounting policy and disclosures(continued)  (iii) New standards and interpretations not yet adopted(continued)   IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information   to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s   contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct   the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service. The standard replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 ‘Construction contracts’   and related interpretations. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and earlier application is   permitted. The Company is assessing the impact of IFRS 15.   IFRS 16,’Leases’ After ten years of joint drafting by the IASB and FASB they decided that lessees should be required to recognise assets   and liabilities arising from all leases (with limited exceptions) on the balance sheet. Lessor accounting has not substantially changed in the   new standard.   The model reflects that, at the start of a lease, the lessee obtains the right to use an asset for a period of time and has an obligation to pay   for that right. In response to concerns expressed about the cost and complexity to apply the requirements to large volumes of small assets,   the IASB decided not to require a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for short-term leases (less than 12 months), and leases for which   the underlying asset is of low value (such as laptops and office furniture).   A lessee measures lease liabilities at the present value of future lease payments. A lessee measures lease assets, initially at the same   amount as lease liabilities, and also includes costs directly related to entering into the lease. Lease assets are amortised in a similar way to   other assets such as property, plant and equipment.   This approach will result in a more faithful representation of a lessee’s assets and liabilities and, together with enhanced disclosures, will   provide greater transparency of a lessee’s financial leverage and capital employed.   One of the implications of the new standard is that there will be a change to key financial ratios derived from a lessee’s assets and liabilities   (for example, leverage and performance ratios).   IFRS 16 supersedes IAS 17, ‘Leases’, IFRIC 4, ‘Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease’, SIC 15, ‘Operating Leases –   Incentives’ and SIC 27, ‘Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease’. The standards is effective for annual   periods beginning 1 January 2019. Early adoption is permitted only if IFRS 15 is adopted at the same time.   Recognition of Deferred Tax Asset for Unrealised Losses-Amendment to IAS 12;Amendments made to IAS 12 in January 2016 clarify the   accounting for deferred tax where an asset is measured at fair value and that fair value is below the asset’s tax base. Specifically, the   amendments confirm that:   •	 A temporary difference exists whenever the carrying amount of an asset is less than its tax base at the end of the reporting period.   •	 An entity can assume that it will recover an amount higher than the carrying amount of an asset to estimate its future taxable profit.   •	 Where the tax law restricts the source of taxable profits against which particular types of deferred tax assets can be recovered, the       recoverability of the deferred tax assets can only be assessed in combination with other deferred tax assets of the same type.   •	 T ax deductions resulting from the reversal of deferred tax assets are excluded from the estimated future taxable profit that is used to       evaluate the recoverability of those assets.   The amendment to IAS 12 is effective 1 January 2017.The Company is yet to assess the impact of the new standards /amendments.  (b) Revenue recognition   Premiums are recognised as revenue when earned from the policyholders. Premiums are shown before deduction of commission.   Commissions receivable are recognised as income in the period in which they are earned.   Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis that takes into account the effective yield on the asset.   Dividends receivable are recognised as income in the period in which the right to receive payment is established.   Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.                                                                                                                                                                        41","ANNUAL REPORT                                                               AND FINANCIAL                                                                    STATEMENTS                                                                                2016    ACCOUNTING    POLICIES (continued)    1 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)    (c) Claims incurred    Claims and policyholders’ benefits payable comprise claims paid in the year and changes in the provision for insurance contract liabilities.    Claims paid represent all payments made during the year, whether arising from events occurring during that or earlier years. Insurance    contract liabilities represent the estimated ultimate cost of settling all claims arising from incidents occurring prior to the end of the    reporting period, but not settled at that date. Insurance contract liabilities are computed on the basis of the best information available at    the time the records for the year are closed, and include provisions for claims intimated but not paid. Insurance contract liabilities are not    discounted.    Claims arising on maturing policies are recognised when the claim becomes due for payment. Death claims are accounted for on notification.    Surrenders are accounted for on payment.    (d) Deposit administration contracts    The Company administers the funds of a number of retirement benefit schemes. The Company’s liabilities in relation to these schemes    have been treated as payables in the statement of financial position. The liabilities with respect to the deposit administration contracts are    determined by the Consulting Actuary on an annual basis.    (e) Reinsurance    The Company assumes and cedes reinsurance in the normal course of business, with retention limits varying by line of business. Premiums    on reinsurance assumed are recognised as income in the same manner as they would be if the reinsurance were considered direct business.    Premiums ceded and claims reimbursed are presented on a gross basis in profit and loss and statement of financial position as appropriate.    Reinsurance assets represent balances due from reinsurance companies. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner    consistent with the outstanding claims provision or settled claims associated with the reinsurer’s policies and are in accordance with the    related reinsurance contract.    Impairment occurs when there is objective evidence as a result of an event that occurred after initial recognition of the reinsurance asset    that the company may not receive all outstanding amounts due under the terms of the contract and the event has a reliably measurable    impact on the amounts that the company will receive from the reinsurer. The impairment loss is recognised in the profit or loss.    Ceded reinsurance arrangements do not relieve the Company from its obligations to policyholders. The Company also assumes reinsurance    risk in the normal course of business for life insurance and non-life insurance contracts where applicable. Premiums and claims on assumed    reinsurance are recognised as revenue or expenses in the same manner as they would be if the reinsurance were considered direct business,    taking into account the product classification of the reinsured business. Reinsurance liabilities represent balances due to reinsurance    companies. Amounts payable are estimated in a manner consistent with the related reinsurance contract.    Reinsurance assets or liabilities are derecognized when the contractual rights are extinguished or expire or when the contract is transferred    to another party.    (f) Equipment    All equipment are initially recorded at cost less depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. The useful lives used in determining    depreciation charge are:    Computer equipment 	  	  3 years    Motor vehicles 	      	 4 years    Furniture fittings and equipment 	 8 years    The residual values of items of equipment and their estimated useful lives are reviewed at the reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.    Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down immediately to its recoverable    amount.    Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are determined by reference to their carrying amounts.    (g) Intangible assets – Computer software    Intangible assets comprise of computer software costs which are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses.    Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost of computer software on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life of five years.42","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           STATEMENTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        2016ACCOUNTINGPOLICIES (continued)1 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)  (h) Investment properties   Investment properties comprises land and buildings held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation. They are carried at fair value,   determined at the reporting date by valuation experts with experience and knowledge of the locations where the properties are located.   Fair value is based on active market prices as adjusted, if necessary, for any difference in the nature, condition or location of the specific   asset.   Investment properties are not subject to depreciation. Changes in their carrying amount between end of reporting periods are dealt with,   through profit or loss for the year. Upon disposal of an investment property, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the   carrying amount is charged or credited to profit or loss for the year.  (i) Financial Instruments  Financial Assets   The company classifies its financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and   receivables, held-to-maturity financial assets and available-for-sale financial assets. The classification adopted for a particular investment   depends on the purpose for which the investment was acquired. Management determines the classification of its investments at initial   recognition and re-evaluates this at every reporting period end.  i) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”)   This category has two sub-categories: financial assets held for trading and those designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception.   A financial asset is classified into this category at inception if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the year, if it forms part of a   portfolio of financial assets in which there is evidence of profit-taking or if so designated by management.  ii) Loans and receivables   Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.   Receivables arising from insurance contracts are also classified in this category and are reviewed for impairment as part of the impairment   review of loans and receivables.  iii) Held-to-maturity financial assets   Held-to-maturity financial assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities – other than those   that meet the definition of loans and receivables – that the company’s management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity.  iv) Available-for-sale financial assets   This classification represents financial assets that are not (a) financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, (b) loans and receivables, or   (c) financial assets held to maturity.  Recognition of financial assets   Financial assets are initially recognised cost plus transaction costs. Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through   profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value. Loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortized cost   using the effective interest method. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of “financial assets at fair value through profit   or loss” are dealt with in the profit or loss in the period in which they arise. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of   available-for-sale financial assets are recognised through other comprehensive income and accumulated under a separate heading of fair   value reserve in the statement of changes in equity, until the financial asset is derecognized or impaired, at which time the cumulative gain   or loss previously recognised through other comprehensive income is recognised in the profit or loss for the year.  Effective interest method   The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income over the   relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated cash receipts including all fees, transaction costs and   premiums or discounts through the expected life of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.  Impairment of financial assets   Financial assets, other than those at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date.   Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial   recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.   Objective evidence of impairment for receivables could include the company’s past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the   number of delayed payments past the average credit period as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that   correlate with default on receivables.                                                                                                                                                                        43","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     STATEMENTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2016  ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)   1 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)      (i) Financial Instruments (continued)     Financial Assets (continued)      Impairment of financial assets (continued)        The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade        receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered        uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are recognized as        income in the profit and loss account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.      Derecognition of financial assets        The Company derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire; or it transfers the        financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the company neither transfers nor        retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Company recognizes its        retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the company retains substantially all the risks        and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Company continues to recognize the financial asset and also recognizes a        collateralized borrowing for the proceeds received.      Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Company        Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual        arrangement.      Classification as debt or equity        An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity        instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.      Financial liabilities        Financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs and are subsequently measured at        amortized cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. The effective interest        method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The        effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability,        or, where appropriate, a shorter period.      Derecognition of financial liabilities        The company derecognizes financial liabilities when, and only when, the company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.      (j) Determination of fair value           For financial instruments traded in active markets, the determination of fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities is based on           the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at           the measurement date. This includes listed equity securities and quoted debt instruments on major exchange (NSE). The quoted market           price used for financial assets held by the company is the current bid price.           For financial instruments traded in active markets, the determination of fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities is based on           the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at           the measurement date. This includes listed equity securities and quoted debt instruments on major exchange (NSE). The quoted market           price used for financial assets held by the company is the current bid price.           A financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange,           dealer, broker, industry, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions           on an arm’s length basis. If the above criteria are not met, the market is regarded as being inactive.           For example a market is inactive when there is a wide bid-offer spread or significant increase in the bid-offer spread or there are few           recent transactions.           For all other financial instruments, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. In these techniques, fair values are estimated from           observable data in respect of similar financial instruments, using models to estimate the present value of expected future cash flows or           other valuation techniques, using inputs existing at the dates of the statement of financial position.44","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           STATEMENTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        2016ACCOUNTINGPOLICIES (continued)1 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)  (j) Determination of fair value (continued)   Fair values are categorized into three levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the degree to which the inputs to the measurement are   observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety:   •	 Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   •	 L evel 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for       the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).   •	 Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not       based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).   Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognised by the company at the end of the reporting period during which the   change occurred.  (k) Translation of foreign currencies  (i) Functional and presentation currency   Items included in the financial statements of each of the Company’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic   environment in which the entity operates (the ‘functional currency’).The financial statements are presented in Kenya shillings rounded to   the nearest thousand (“Shs”), which is the Company’s presentation currency.  (ii) Transactions and balances   Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions   or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and   from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in   the statement of profit or loss, except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net   investment hedges.   Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the statement of profit or loss   within finance income or costs’. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the statement of profit or loss within other   (losses)/gains.  (l) Accounting for leases   Leases of assets where a significant proportion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the company as a lessee are classified   as finance leases. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to profit or loss   for the year on the straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  (m) Employee entitlements   Employee entitlements to long service awards are recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made for the estimated   liability for such entitlements as a result of services rendered by employees up to the reporting date. The estimated monetary liability for   employees’ accrued annual leave entitlement at the reporting date is recognised as an expense accrual.  (n) Income tax expense   Income tax expense is the aggregate amount charged /(credited) in respect of current income tax and deferred income tax in determining   the profit or loss for the year. Tax is recognised in the profit or loss except when it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive   income, in which case it is also recognised in other comprehensive income, or to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is also   recognised directly in equity.  Current income tax   Current income tax is the amount of income tax payable on the taxable profit for the year, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect   of prior years, determined in accordance with the Kenyan Income Tax Act.  Deferred income tax asset   Deferred income tax is provided in full on all temporary differences except those arising on the initial recognition of an asset or liability,   other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither the accounting nor taxable profit nor loss. Deferred   income tax is determined using the liability method on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and   their carrying values for financial reporting purposes, using tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date   and expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred tax liability is settled.                                                                                                                                                                        45","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     STATEMENTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2016  ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)   1 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)      (n) Income tax expense (continued)      Deferred income tax asset (continued)        Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which        temporary differences can be utilized.      (o) Retirement benefit obligations        The company operates a defined contribution scheme for its employees. The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee        administered fund, which is funded from contributions from both the company and employees. Contributions are determined by the rules        of the scheme.        The company also contributes to the statutory defined contribution pension scheme, the National Social Security Fund (NSSF). Contributions        to this scheme are determined by local statute. The company’s obligations to these schemes are charged to profit or loss in the year they        fall due.      (p) Dividend distribution        Dividend distributions to the company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the year in which the        dividends are approved by the shareholders. Proposed dividends are shown as separate component of equity until declared.      (q) Share capital        Ordinary shares are recognised at par value and classified as ‘share capital’ in equity. Any amounts received over and above the par value        of the shares issued are classified as ‘share premium’ in equity.        Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from        the proceeds.        Shares are classified as equity when there is no obligation to transfer cash or other assets.      (r) Bonus stabilisation reserve        The bonus stabilisation reserve represents amount of surplus set aside to allow for smoothening of return        of interest declaration for the deposit administration schemes based on the recommendation of the independent         actuarial consultant.       (s) Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty        In the process of applying the company’s accounting policies, management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported        amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on        historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.       (i) Critical judgments in applying the company’s accounting policies        The key areas of judgment in applying the company’s accounting policies are dealt with as follows:      Future benefit payments from long-term insurance contracts        The estimation of future benefit payments from long-term insurance contracts is one of the company’s most critical accounting estimates.        There are several sources of uncertainty that need to be considered in the estimate of the liability that the company will ultimately pay for        such claims.        The determination of the liabilities under long-term insurance contracts is dependent on estimates made by the company. Estimates are        made as to the expected number of deaths for each of the years in which the company is exposed to risk. The company bases these        estimates on standard mortality tables that reflect historical mortality experience. The estimated number of deaths determines the value        of the benefit payments and the value of the valuation premiums. The main source of uncertainty is that epidemics such as AIDS could        result in future mortality being significantly worse than in the past for the age Company’s in which the company has significant exposure        to mortality risk.46","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           STATEMENTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        2016ACCOUNTINGPOLICIES (continued)1 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)  (s) Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)  Future benefit payments from long-term insurance contracts (continued)   However, continuing improvements in medical care and social conditions could result in improvements in longevity in excess of those   allowed for in the estimates used to determine the liability for contracts where the company is exposed to longevity risk. For contracts   without fixed terms and with discretionary participation in profits, it is assumed that the company will be able to increase mortality risk   charges in future years in line with emerging mortality experience. Estimates are also made as to future investment income arising from the   assets backing long-term insurance contracts. These estimates are based on current market returns as well as expectations about future   economic and financial developments. The average estimated rate of investment return is 5.0%p.a. (2015: 6.00% p.a).  Held-to-maturity investments   The company follows the guidance of IAS 39 in classifying non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed   maturity as held-to-maturity. This classification requires significant judgement. In making this judgement, the company evaluates its   intention and ability to hold such investments to maturity. If the company fails to hold these investments to maturity other than for the   specific circumstances - for example, selling more than an insignificant amount close to maturity - it will be required to reclassify the entire   class as available-for-sale. The investments would therefore be measured at fair value and not at amortized cost.  Key sources of estimation uncertainty  Impairment losses   At the reporting date, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any   indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated   in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset,   the company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.  Equipment   Critical estimates are made by the company’s directors, in determining depreciation rates and useful lives for equipment.                                                                                                                                                                        47","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     STATEMENTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2016  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   1 Incorporation and registered office        APA Life Assurance Limited is a limited liability company incorporated in Kenya under the Kenyan Companies Act and domiciled in Kenya.        The parent company, which is the ultimate holding company is Apollo Investments Limited which is incorporated in Kenya. The address of        its registered office is 07Apollo Centre, Ring Road Parklands, Westlands, Nairobi.   2 Risk management objectives and policies        The company’s activities expose it to a variety of risks, including insurance risk, financial risk, credit risk, and the effects of changes in        property values, debt and equity market prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The company’s overall risk management        programme focuses on the identification and management of risks and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on its financial        performance, by use of underwriting guidelines and capacity limits, reinsurance planning, credit policy governing the acceptance of clients,        and defined criteria for the approval of intermediaries and reinsurers. Investment policies are in place which help manage liquidity, and        seek to maximize return within an acceptable level of interest rate risk. The company manages key risks as follows:      2.1 Insurance risk management        The risk under any one insurance contract is the possibility that the insured event occurs and the uncertainty of the amount of the resulting        claim. By the very nature of an insurance contract, this risk is random and therefore unpredictable.        For a portfolio of insurance contracts where the theory of probability is applied to pricing and provisioning, the principal risk that the        company faces under its insurance contracts is that the actual claims and benefit payments exceed the carrying amount of the insurance        liabilities. This could occur because the frequency or severity of claims and benefits are greater than estimated. Insurance events are        random and the actual number and amount of claims and benefits will vary from year to year from the level established using statistical        techniques. Experience shows that the larger the portfolio of similar insurance contracts, the smaller the relative variability of the expected        outcome will be. In addition, a more diversified portfolio is less likely to be affected across the board by a change in any subset of the        portfolio.        The company has developed its insurance underwriting and investment strategy to diversify the type of risks accepted and within each of        these categories to achieve a sufficiently large population of risks to reduce the variability of the expected outcome. Factors that aggravate        insurance risk include lack of risk diversification in terms of type and amount of risk, geographical, local and type of industry covered.        The company’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize potential        adverse effects on the company’s financial performance. It manages these positions within an asset-liability management (ALM) framework        that has been developed to achieve investment returns in excess of obligations under insurance contracts. The company produces regular        reports at portfolio, legal entity and asset and liability class level that are circulated to the company’s key management personnel. The        principal technique of the company’s ALM framework is to match assets to the liabilities arising from insurance contracts by reference to        the type of benefits payable to contract holders. Separate portfolios of assets are maintained for with-profit business, non-linked non-        profit business, and unit-linked business. For the purposes of the ALM framework, the company does not manage the fund for future        appropriations as a liability. The company’s ALM is also integrated with the management of the financial risks associated with the company’s        other financial assets and liabilities not directly associated with insurance and investment liabilities. The company does not use hedge        accounting.        The company has not changed the processes used to manage its risks from previous periods. The notes below explain how insurance risks        are managed using the categories utilized in the company’s ALM framework.48","ANNUAL REPORT                                                          AND FINANCIAL                                                               STATEMENTS                                                                           2016NOTES TO THEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)2 Risk management objectives and policies (continued)  2.1 Insurance risk management (continued)   The company engages in long-term insurance contracts and funds the insurance liabilities with a portfolio of equity and debt securities   exposed to market risk.

In particular, the key financial risk is that the proceeds from financial assets are not sufficientto fund the obligations arising from insurance policies and investment contracts as they fall due. The most important components of thisfinancial risk are market risk (including interest rate risk, equity price risk and currency risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.These risks arise from open positions in interest rate, currency and equity products, all of which are exposed to general and specific marketmovements. The risks that the company primarily faces due to the nature of its investments and liabilities are interest rate risk and equityprice risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              51","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     STATEMENTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2016  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)   2 Risk management objectives and policies (continued)      2.2 Financial risk management (continued)      (a) Market risks      (i) Interest rate risk        Interest rate risk arises primarily from investments in fixed interest securities. In addition to the extent that claims costs are related to        interest rates, liabilities to policyholders are exposed to interest rate risk. Insurance and non profit investment contracts have benefit        payments that are fixed and guaranteed at the inception of the contract. The financial component of these benefits is usually a guaranteed        fixed interest rate (for the insurance contracts, this rate may apply to maturity and/or death benefits) and hence the company’s primary        financial risk on these contracts is the risk that interest income and capital redemptions from the financial assets backing the liabilities are        insufficient to fund the guaranteed benefits payable.        The company monitors interest rate risk by calculating the mean duration of the investment portfolio and of the liabilities to policyholders        under insurance and investment contracts. The mean duration is an indicator of the sensitivity of the assets and liabilities to changes in        current interest rates. The mean duration of the liabilities is determined by means of projecting expected cash flows from the contracts        using best estimates of mortality and voluntary terminations. This is calculated in a consistent manner with the prior year. Any gap between        the mean duration of the assets and the estimated mean duration of the liabilities is minimised by means of buying and selling fixed interest        securities of different durations.        The sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk illustrates how changes in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will        fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates at the reporting date. For the guaranteed element of liabilities under with-profits        contracts, changes in interest rate will not cause a change to the amount of the liability because their carrying amounts are not affected by        the level of market interest rates. However the with profits element of the liabilities is directly affected by changes in the level of interest        rates to the extent that they affect the carrying amount of the assets held in the with-profits funds.        The company’s management monitors the sensitivity of reported interest rate movements on a monthly basis by assessing the expected        changes in the different portfolios.        Interest bearing instruments securities represent 78% (2015: 70%) of total investments. If interest rates in market indices had increased        / decreased by a further 5%, with all other variables held constant, and all the company’s investments moving according to the historical        correlation with the index, income would increase / decrease by Shs 16.5million (2015: Shs10.6million).      (ii) Equity price risk        The company is exposed to equity securities price risk as a result of its holdings in equity investments, classified as financial assets available        for sale. Exposures to individual companies and to equity shares in aggregate are monitored in order to ensure compliance with the relevant        regulatory limits for solvency purposes. Investments held are listed and traded on the Nairobi Stock Exchange and other recognised stock        exchanges.        The company has a defined investment policy which sets limits on the company’s exposure to equities both in aggregate terms and by        geography, industry and counterparty. This policy of diversification is used to manage the company’s price risk arising from its investments        in equity securities. Investment management meetings are held daily. At these meetings, senior investment managers meet to discuss        investment return and concentration across the company.        The sensitivity analysis for equity risk illustrates how changes in the fair value of equity securities will fluctuate because of changes to        market prices, whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual equity issuer, or factors affecting all similar equity        securities traded in the market.        Listed equities securities represent 97% (2015: 95%) of total equity investments. If equity market indices had increased / decreased by a        further 5%, with all other variables held constant, and all the company’s equity investments moving according to the historical correlation        with the index, equity would increase / decrease by Shs17.9million (2015: Shs 31.5million).      (iii) Currency risk        Foreign currency exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets and liabilities are denominated in a        currency that is not the entity’s functional currency. The company primarily transacts in the Kenya shilling and its assets and liabilities are        denominated in the same currency. The company is therefore not exposed to currency risk.52","ANNUAL REPORT                                                         AND FINANCIAL                                                              STATEMENTS                                                                          2016NOTES TO THEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)2 Risk management objectives and policies (continued)  2.2 Financial risk management (continued)  (b) Credit risk   Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due. Key areas where the company is exposed to credit   risk are:   •	 reinsurers’ share of insurance liabilities and reserves;   •	 amounts due from reinsurers in respect of claims already paid;   •	 amounts due from insurance contract holders;   •	 amounts due from insurance intermediaries;   •	 amounts due from corporate bond issuers and   •	 amount held with financial institutions - under cash and cash equivalents   The company manages the levels of credit risk it accepts by placing limits on its exposure to a single counterparty, or Companys of   counterparties and to geographical and industry segments. Such risks are subject to regular review. Limits on the level of credit risk by   category and territory are approved quarterly by the board of directors.   Reinsurance is used to manage insurance risk. This does not, however, discharge the company of its liability as the primary insurer. If   a reinsurer fails to pay a claim, the company remains liable for the payment to the policyholder. The creditworthiness of reinsurers is   considered on an annual basis by reviewing their financial strength prior to finalization of any contract. In addition, management assesses   the creditworthiness of all reinsurers and intermediaries by reviewing credit grades provided by rating agencies and other publicly available   financial information. The recent payment history of reinsurers is also used to update the reinsurance purchasing strategy.   Management information reported to the directors include details of provisions for impairment on receivables and subsequent write offs.   Internal audit makes regular reviews to assess the degree of compliance with the company’s procedures on credit. Exposures to individual   policyholders and groups of policyholders are within the ongoing monitoring of the controls associated with regulatory solvency. Where   there exists significant exposure to individual policyholders or homogenous groups of policyholders, a financial analysis is carried out by   the management.

The primary liquidity risk of       the company is the obligation to pay claims to policyholders as they fall due. The projected settlement of these liabilities is modelled, on       a regular basis, using actuarial techniques. The board sets limits on the minimum proportion of maturing funds available to meet such calls       and on the minimum level of borrowing facilities that should be in place to cover anticipated liabilities and unexpected levels of demand.

A market isregarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service,or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. The quotedmarket price used for financial assets held by the company is the current bid price. These instruments are included in level 1. Instrumentsincluded in level 1 comprise primarily Nairobi Securities Exchange (“NSE”) equity investments and government bonds classified as availablefor sale.The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined byusing valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little aspossible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is includedin level 2.If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include2.4 Capital risk managementThe company maintains an efficient capital structure from a combination of equity shareholders’ funds and borrowings, consistent with thecompany’s risk profile and the regulatory and market requirements of its business.The company is subject to a number of regulatory capital tests and also employ a number of realistic tests to allocate capital and manage risk.In reporting the company’s financial strength, capital and solvency is measured using the regulations prescribed by the Insurance RegulatoryAuthority (IRA). These regulatory capital tests are based upon required levels of solvency capital and a series of prudent assumptions inrespect of the type of business written by the company.The company’s objectives in managing its capital are:•	 to match the profile of its assets and liabilities, taking account of the risks inherent in the business;•	 to maintain financial strength to support business growth;•	 to satisfy the requirements of its policyholders, regulators and rating agencies;•	 to retain financial flexibility by maintaining strong liquidity and access to a range of capital markets;•	 to allocate capital efficiently to support growth; and•	 to manage exposures to movement in exchange rate                                                                                                                                                                     55","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                            AND FINANCIAL                                                                                 STATEMENTS                                                                                             2016    NOTES TO THE    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)    2 Risk management objectives and policies (continued)      2.4 Capital risk management (continued)       An important aspect of the company’s overall capital management process is the setting of target risk-adjusted rates of return for       individual business units, which are aligned to performance objectives and ensure that the company is focused on the creation of value for       shareholders.       The company has a number of sources of capital available to it and seeks to optimise its debt to equity structure in order to ensure that       it can consistently maximise returns to shareholders. The company considers not only the traditional sources of capital funding but the       alternative sources of capital including reinsurance, as appropriate, when assessing its deployment and usage of capital. The company       manages as capital all items that are eligible to be treated as capital for regulatory purposes.       The company is regulated by the Insurance Regulatory Authority in Kenya. The Insurance Act Requires each insurance company to hold the       minimum level of paid up capital for long term Insurance companies at the minimum amount of Shs 150 Million.       In Kenya the solvency and capital adequacy margins are calculated based on Kenyan Solvency Law, which requires the application of a       formula that contains variables for expenses and admitted assets, as contained in section 41 of the Insurance Act.       General insurance businesses are required to keep a solvency margin, i.e. admitted assets less admitted liabilities, equivalent to the higher       of Shs 10 million or 15% of the net premium income during the preceding financial year.       An insurer carrying on in Kenya long term insurance business but not general insurance business shall keep at all times total admitted assets       of not less than his total admitted liabilities and ten million shillings or five per centum of the total admitted liabilities, whichever is higher       The solvency margin of the Company as at 31 December 2016 and 2015 is illustrated below.

At the reporting date, there was no litigation that the company was aware of. The directors are of the opinion that any litigation that may   arise from this source will not have a material effect on the financial position or profits of the company.   In 2015, the company received a tax assessment for principal tax of Shs 33,745,125 for prior periods, which is in dispute and the company   is contesting the assessment. No provision has been made in these financial statements for these amounts as the company considers it has   adequate grounds to dispute the assessment.   On 24 January 2017, the company received a tax assessment for principal tax of Shs 14,855,078 in relation excise duty arising from   reinsurance commission for prior periods. These amount is in dispute and the company is contesting the assessment. The directors have   made provisions in these financial statements which in their view they consider to be adequate to cover the exposure the company may   have in future arising from the assessment.                                                                                                                                                67","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                  AND FINANCIAL                                                                                       STATEMENTS                                                                                                   2016    NOTES TO THE    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)    32 Operating leasecommitments       The future minimum lease payments under operating leases are as follows:    Due not later than 1 year                                                       2016                    2015    Due after 1 year and not later than 5 years                                  Shs’000                 Shs’000    Later than 5 years    Total                                                                              9,461                   9,461                                                                                      62,561                  54,401                                                                                      14,144                  12,299                                                                                      86,166                  76,161    33 Related parties       In the normal course of business, insurance policies are sold to related parties at terms and conditions similar to those offered to major       clients.
