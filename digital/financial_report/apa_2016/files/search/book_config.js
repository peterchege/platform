The valuation was conducted in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and in accordance with the requirements of the    Insurance Act, Cap. 487 of the Laws of Kenya. Those principles require that prudent principles for future outgo under contracts, generally    based upon the assumptions that current conditions will continue. Provision is therefore not made for all possible contingencies.    In completing the actuarial valuation, I have relied upon the audited financial statements of the company.    In my opinion, the insurer’s insurance liabilities reserves of the company were adequate as at 31 December 2016.    Name of Actuary		                          James I. O.

Other information    The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report but    does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.    Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion    thereon.    In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so,    consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or    otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information, we conclude that there is a    material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.    Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the financial statements    The directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with International Financial    Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Kenyan Companies Act 2015, and for such internal control as the directors determine is    necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.    In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern,    disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend    to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.    The directors are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.    Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements    Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement,    whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but    is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements    can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence    the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.    As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.    We also:    •	 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit       procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The       risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,       forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.30","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             STATEMENTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2016INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THEMEMBERS OF APA INSURANCE LIMITED (continued)O ther information (continued)Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (continued)•	 O btain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the   circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.•	 E valuate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made   by the directors.•	 Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained,   whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as   a going concern.

We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unlesslaw or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter shouldnot be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the publicinterest benefits of such communication.Report on other legal requirementsAs required by the Kenyan Companies Act 2015 we report to you, based on our audit, that:   i) w e have obtained all the information and explanations which to the best of our knowledge and belief were necessary for the purposes     of our audit;   ii) in our opinion proper books of account have been kept by the company, so far as appears from our examination of those books;   iii) the company’s statement of financial position and statement of comprehensive income are in agreement with the books of account.The engagement partner responsible for the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is FCPA Richard Njoroge- P/No.1244.Certified Public Accountants	Nairobi15 March 2017                                                                                                                                                                        31","ANNUAL REPORT                                       AND FINANCIAL                                            STATEMENTS                                                        2016                      An estimated    3There   White                                         are  Rhinos   40,000                               only                 African Elephants    left in the                are killed each year          world.32","ANNUAL REPORT                      AND FINANCIAL                           STATEMENTS                                       2016                     SAVE OUR ANIMALS                         BEFORE IT’S TOO                                           LATE                          Poaching is a persistent global                                  problem with a profound                                 effect on the East African                                  region.

            2016  ACCOUNTING POLICIES     The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below:   1 General information        APA Insurance Limited (“the Company”) is in the transaction of general insurance business and is incorporated in Kenya under the        Companies Act as a private limited liability company. The Company is domiciled in Kenya and the address of its registered office is        disclosed under page 6.        For the Kenyan Companies Act reporting purposes, the balance sheet is presented by statement of financial position and the profit and        loss account is presented by the statement of comprehensive income.   2 Summary of significant accounting policies            The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been            consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.   (a) Basis of preparation            The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). The measurement            basis applied is the historical cost basis, except for investment properties and available for sale financial assets, which have been            measured at fair value.            The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires            the directors to exercise judgement in the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree            of judgement or complexity, or where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in Note 2(v).        Changes in accounting policy and disclosures          (i) New and amended standards adopted by the Company            The following standards and amendments have been applied by the Company for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January            2016:            Amendments to IAS 1, ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’: The amendments are made in the context of the IASB’s Disclosure            Initiative, which explores how financial statement disclosures can be improved. The amendments, effective 1 January 2016, provide            clarifications on a number of issues, including:            •	 Materiality – an entity should not aggregate or disaggregate information in a manner that obscures useful information. Where items                   are material, sufficient information must be provided to explain the impact on the financial position or performance.            •	 D isaggregation and subtotals – line items specified in IAS 1 may need to be disaggregated where this is relevant to an understanding                   of the entity’s financial position or performance. There is also new guidance on the use of subtotals.            •	 Notes – confirmation that the notes do not need to be presented in a particular order.            •	 O CI arising from investments accounted for under the equity method – the share of OCI arising from equity-accounted investments                   is grouped based on whether the items will or will not subsequently be reclassified to profit or loss. Each Company should then be                   presented as a single line item in the statement of other comprehensive income.            According to the transitional provisions, the disclosures in IAS 8 regarding the adoption of new standards/accounting policies are not            required for these amendments.            The Company has elected to adopt the following two amendments early:            Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle. The latest annual improvements, effective 1 January 2016, clarify:            •	 I	FRS 7 – specific guidance for transferred financial assets to help management determine whether the terms of a servicing                   arrangement constitute ‘continuing involvement’ and, therefore, whether the asset qualifies for de recognition.            •	 IFRS 7 – that the additional disclosures relating to the offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities only need to be included                   in interim reports if required by IAS 34.            Amendment to IAS 27;The IASB has made amendments to IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements which will allow entities to use the            equity method in their separate financial statements to measure investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates.            IAS 27 currently allows entities to measure their investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates either at cost or as a financial            asset in their separate financial statements. The amendments introduce the equity method as a third option. The election can be made            independently for each category of investment (subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates). Entities wishing to change to the equity            method must do so retrospectively.            As these amendments merely clarify the existing requirements, they do not affect the Company’s accounting policies or any of the            disclosures.40","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             STATEMENTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2016ACCOUNTINGPOLICIES (continued)2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)(a) Basis of preparation (continued)    Changes in accounting policy and disclosures(continued)      (ii) New standards and interpretations not yet adopted       IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The       complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement       of financial instruments. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement       categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through OCI and fair value through P&L. The basis of classification depends       on the entity’s business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity instruments are       required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in       OCI not recycling. There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39.       For financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk       in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss.       Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared under IAS 39. The standard is effective for       accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Early adoption is permitted.       The Company is yet to assess the impact of IFRS 9.       A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January       2016, and have not been applied in preparing these financial statement. None of these is expected to have a significant effect on the       financial statements of the Company, except the following set out below:       IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful       information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an       entity’s contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability       to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service. The standard replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 ‘Construction       contracts’ and related interpretations. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and earlier       application is permitted. The Company is yet to assess the impact of IFRS 15.       IFRS 16,’Leases’ After ten years of joint drafting by the IASB and FASB they decided that lessees should be required to recognise assets       and liabilities arising from all leases (with limited exceptions) on the balance sheet. Lessor accounting has not substantially changed in       the new standard.       The model reflects that, at the start of a lease, the lessee obtains the right to use an asset for a period of time and has an obligation to       pay for that right. In response to concerns expressed about the cost and complexity to apply the requirements to large volumes of small       assets, the IASB decided not to require a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for short-term leases (less than 12 months), and leases       for which the underlying asset is of low value (such as laptops and office furniture).       A lessee measures lease liabilities at the present value of future lease payments. A lessee measures lease assets, initially at the same       amount as lease liabilities, and also includes costs directly related to entering into the lease. Lease assets are amortised in a similar way       to other assets such as property, plant and equipment.       This approach will result in a more faithful representation of a lessee’s assets and liabilities and, together with enhanced disclosures, will       provide greater transparency of a lessee’s financial leverage and capital employed.       One of the implications of the new standard is that there will be a change to key financial ratios derived from a lessee’s assets and       liabilities (for example, leverage and performance ratios).       IFRS 16 supersedes IAS 17, ‘Leases’, IFRIC 4, ‘Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease’, SIC 15, ‘Operating Leases –       Incentives’ and SIC 27, ‘Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease’. The standards is effective for       annual periods beginning 1 January 2019. Early adoption is permitted only if IFRS 15 is adopted at the same time.       Recognition of Deferred Tax Asset for Unrealised Losses - Amendment to IAS 12;Amendments made to IAS 12 in January 2016 clarify       the accounting for deferred tax where an asset is measured at fair value and that fair value is below the asset’s tax base. Specifically,       the amendments confirm that:       •	 A temporary difference exists whenever the carrying amount of an asset is less than its tax base at the end of the reporting period.       •	 An entity can assume that it will recover an amount higher than the carrying amount of an asset to estimate its future taxable profit.       •	 Where the tax law restricts the source of taxable profits against which particular types of deferred tax assets can be recovered,              the recoverability of the deferred tax assets can only be assessed in combination with other deferred tax assets of the same type.       •	 T ax deductions resulting from the reversal of deferred tax assets are excluded from the estimated future taxable profit that is used              to evaluate the recoverability of those assets.       The amendment to IAS 12 is effective 1 January 2017.                                                                                                                                                                        41","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       STATEMENTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   2016  ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)   2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)   (b) Investment in associates            Associates are all entities over which the Company has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding            of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.            Under the equity method, the investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise            the investor’s share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The Company’s investment in associates includes            goodwill identified on acquisition.            If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts            previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.            The Company’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss, and its share of post-acquisition            movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the            carrying amount of the investment. When the Company’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate,            including any other unsecured receivables, the Company does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive            obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.            The Company determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired.            If this is the case, the Company calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate            and its carrying value and recognises the amount adjacent to ‘share of profit/ (loss) of associates in the statement of profit or loss.            Profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the Company and its associate are            recognised in the Company’s financial statements only to the extent of unrelated investor’s interests in the associates.            Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting            policies of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Company.            Dilution gains and losses arising in investments in associates are recognised in the statement of profit or loss.   (c) Income recognition            Premium income is recognised on assumption of risks, and includes estimates of premium due but not yet received less an allowance for            unearned premium. Unearned premium represent the proportion of the premium written in periods up to the accounting date that relate            to the unexpired terms of policies in force at the reporting date, and is calculated using the 1/365th (2015: 1/24th) method on written            premium less reinsurance premium ceded.            Commissions receivable are recognised as income in the period in which they are earned.            Investment income is stated net of investment expenses. Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis that takes into            account the effective yield on the asset. Dividends receivable are recognised as income in the period in which the right to receive            payment is established. Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases.   (d) Claims incurred            Claims incurred comprise claims paid in the year and changes in the provision for outstanding claims. Claims paid represent all payments            made during the year, whether arising from events during that or earlier years.            Outstanding claims represent the estimated ultimate cost of settling all claims arising from incidents occurring prior to the reporting            date, but not settled at that date. Outstanding claims are computed on the basis of the best information available at the time the records            for the year are closed, and include provisions for claims incurred but not reported (“IBNR”). Outstanding claims are not discounted.   (e) Reinsurance            The company assumes and cedes reinsurance in the normal course of business, with retention limits varying by line of business. Premiums            on reinsurance assumed are recognised as income in the same manner as they would be if the reinsurance were considered direct            business. Premiums ceded and claims reimbursed are presented on a gross basis in profit and loss and statement of financial position            as appropriate.            Reinsurance assets represent balances due from reinsurance companies. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner            consistent with the outstanding claims provision or settled claims associated with the reinsurer’s policies and are in accordance with            the related reinsurance contract. Impairment occurs when there is objective evidence as a result of an event that occurred after initial            recognition of the reinsurance asset that the company may not receive all outstanding amounts due under the terms of the contract            and the event has a reliably measurable impact on the amounts that the company will receive from the reinsurer. The impairment loss is            recognised in the profit or loss.42","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                              AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                   STATEMENTS                                                                                                               2016ACCOUNTINGPOLICIES (continued)2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)(e) Reinsurance (continued)Ceded reinsurance arrangements do not relieve the company from its obligations to policyholders. The company also assumes reinsurancerisk in the normal course of business for non-life insurance contracts where applicable. Premiums and claims on assumed reinsurance arerecognised as revenue or expenses in the same manner as they would be if the reinsurance were considered direct business, taking intoaccount the product classification of the reinsured business. Reinsurance liabilities represent balances due to reinsurance companies.Amounts payable are estimated in a manner consistent with the related reinsurance contract.Reinsurance assets or liabilities are derecognised when the contractual rights are extinguished or expire or when the contract istransferred to another party.(f) Insurance contract receivablesInsurance receivables are recognised when due and measured on initial recognition at the fair value of the consideration received orreceivable. Subsequent to initial recognition, insurance receivables are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.The carrying value of insurance receivables is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carryingamount may not be recoverable, with the impairment loss recognised in profit or loss.(g) Deferred acquisition costsDeferred acquisition costs represent a proportion of acquisition costs that relate to policies that are in force at the year end. A proportionof commission payable is deferred and amortised over the period in which the related premiums are earned.(h) Property and equipmentAll items of property and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Property and equipment are stated at historical cost less anyaccumulated depreciation.Depreciation is calculated on property and equipment on the straight line basis to write down the cost of each asset, to its residual valueover its estimated useful life as follows:Furniture, fixtures and fittings and office equipment  	 8 yearsMotor vehicles                                         	 4 yearsComputer equipment                                      	 3 yearsAssets’ residual values and their estimated useful lives are reviewed at the reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. Where thecarrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down immediately to its recoverable amount.Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds with their carrying amounts andare recognised within ‘Other gains / (losses)’ in the income statement.(i) Intangible assets – computer softwareIntangible assets comprise of computer software costs which are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairmentlosses. Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost of computer software on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life of5 years.(j) Investment propertyInvestment properties comprise land and buildings and parts of buildings held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation. They arecarried at fair value, determined annually by independent external valuers. Fair value is based on active market prices as adjusted, ifnecessary, for any difference in the nature, condition or location of the specific asset.Investment properties are not subject to depreciation. Changes in their carrying amounts between the reporting dates are dealt withthrough the profit or loss.Upon disposal of an investment property, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount is charged orcredited to profit or loss for the year.(k) Financial assets  ClassificationThe company classifies its financial assets into the following categories: loans and receivables, held-to-maturity financial assets andavailable-for-sale financial assets. The classification adopted for a particular financial asset depends on the purpose for which the assetwas acquired.                                                                                                                                                43","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       STATEMENTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   2016  ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)   2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)   (k) Financial assets (continued)       Classification (continued)            Management determines the classification of its financial asset at initial recognition and re-evaluates this at every reporting date.          i) Loans and receivables            Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.            Receivables arising from insurance contracts are also classified in this category and are reviewed for impairment as part of the impairment            review of loans and receivables.          ii) Available-for-sale financial assets            This classification represents financial assets that are not (a) financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, (b) loans and receivables,            or (c) financial assets held-to-maturity.         iii) Held-to-maturity financial assets            Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the            Company’s management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity, other than:            •	 those that the Company upon initial recognition designates as at fair value through profit or loss;            •	 those that the Company designates as available for sale; and            •	 those that meet the definition of loans and receivables            Interest on held-to-maturity investments are included in the statement of profit or loss and are reported as ‘Interest and similar income’.            In the case of an impairment, it is been reported as a deduction from the carrying value of the investment and recognised in the            statement of profit or loss as ‘Net gains/(losses) on investment securities’.        Recognition and measurement            Financial assets are initially recognised at cost plus transaction costs.            Available-for-sale financial assets subsequently carried at fair value. Loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments are carried            at amortised cost using the effective interest method.            Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in other comprehensive income            and accumulated in investment revaluation reserve in the statement of changes in equity, until the financial asset is derecognised or            impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.          Effective interest method            The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income over the            relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated cash receipts (including all fees, transaction costs            and premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial asset, or where appropriate, a shorter period.        Determination of fair value            For financial instruments traded in active markets, the determination of fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities is based on            the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the            measurement date. This includes listed equity securities and quoted debt instruments on major exchange (Nairobi Securities Exchange).            The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the company is the current bid price.            A financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange,            dealer, broker, industry, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions            on an arm’s length basis. If the above criteria are not met, the market is regarded as being inactive.            For example a market is inactive when there is a wide bid-offer spread or significant increase in the bid-offer spread or there are few            recent transactions.            For all other financial instruments, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. In these techniques, fair values are estimated from            observable data in respect of similar financial instruments, using models to estimate the present value of expected future cash flows or            other valuation techniques, using inputs existing at the dates of the statement of financial position            Fair values are categorised into three levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the degree to which the inputs to the measurement are            observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety:44","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             STATEMENTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2016ACCOUNTINGPOLICIES (continued)2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)(k) Financial assets (continued)     Determination of fair value (continued)       Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.       Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for       the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).       Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not       based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).       Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognised by the company at the end of the reporting period during which the       change occurred.     Impairment of financial assets       Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective       evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash       flows of the investment have been impacted.       Objective evidence of impairment for receivables could include the company’s past experience of collecting payments, an increase in       the number of delayed payments past the average credit period, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions       that correlate with default on receivables.       The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade       receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered       uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited       against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the profit or loss for the year.     Derecognition of financial assets       The company derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire; or it transfers the       financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the company neither transfers nor       retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the company recognises its       retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the company retains substantially all the risks       and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the company continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a       collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.(l) Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the company       Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual       arrangement.      Classification as debt or equity       An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity       instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.      Other financial liabilities       Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs and are subsequently       measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised using the effective interest method.       The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over       the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected       life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.      Derecognition of financial liabilities       The company derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.(m) Cash and cash equivalents       For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and       other short term liquid investments which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which were within three months of       maturity when acquired, less advances from banks repayable within three months from the dates of the advances.                                                                                                                                                                        45","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       STATEMENTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   2016  ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)   2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)   (n) Translation of foreign currencies            The financial statements are presented in Kenya Shillings (Shs) rounded to the nearest thousand, which is the Company’s functional            and reporting currency. In preparing the financial statements, transactions in currencies other than the Company’s functional currency            (foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions.            At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that            date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences            on monetary items are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.   (o) Accounting for leases            Leases of assets where a significant proportion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the company as a lessee are            classified as finance leases. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to            income on the straight-line basis over the term of the lease.   (p) Employee entitlements            Employee entitlements to long service awards are recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made for the estimated            liability for such entitlements as a result of services rendered by employees up to the reporting date. The estimated monetary liability            for employees’ accrued annual leave entitlement at the reporting date is recognised as an expense in profit or loss.   (q) Retirement benefit obligations            The company operates a defined contribution scheme for its employees. The assets of the scheme are held in separate trustee            administered fund, which is funded from contributions from both the company and employees. Contributions are determined by the            rules of the scheme. The company also contributes to the statutory defined contribution pension scheme, the National Social Security            Fund (NSSF). Contributions to this scheme are determined by local statute. The Company’s obligations to these schemes are charged            to profit or loss as they fall due.   (r) Income tax expense            Income tax expense is the aggregate amount charged /(credited) in respect of current income tax and deferred income tax in determining            the profit or loss for the year. Tax is recognised in the profit or loss except when it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive            income, in which case it is also recognised in other comprehensive income, or to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is            also recognised directly in equity.          Current income tax            Current income tax is the amount of income tax payable on the taxable profit for the year, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect            of prior years, determined in accordance with the Kenyan Income Tax Act.          Deferred income tax            Deferred income tax is provided in full on all temporary differences except those arising on the initial recognition of an asset or liability,            other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither the accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred            income tax is determined using the liability method on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities            and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes, using tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet            date and expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.            Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which            temporary differences can be utilised.            Deferred income tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and            joint arrangements, except for deferred income tax liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by            the company and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Generally the company is unable            to control the reversal of the temporary difference for associates. Only where there is an agreement in place that gives the company the            ability to control the reversal of the temporary difference not recognised.            Deferred income tax assets are recognised on deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and            joint arrangements only to the extent that it is probable the temporary difference will reverse in the future and there is sufficient taxable            profit available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.            Recognised and unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and, if appropriate, the recognised            amount is adjusted to reflect the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be            recovered.            Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current income tax assets against            current income tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation            authority on the same entity.46","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             STATEMENTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2016ACCOUNTINGPOLICIES (continued)2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)(s) Dividend distribution       Dividend distributions to the company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the year in which the       dividends are approved by the shareholders.       Proposed dividends are shown as a separate component of equity.(t) Share capital       Ordinary shares are recognised at par value and classified as ‘share capital’ in equity. Any amounts received over and above the par value       of the shares issued are classified as ‘share premium’ in equity.       Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from       the proceeds.       Shares are classified as equity when there is no obligation to transfer cash or other assets.(u) Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty       In the process of applying the company’s accounting policies, management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the       reported amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are       based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the       circumstances.      i) Critical judgments in applying the company’s accounting policies       The key areas of judgment in applying the company’s accounting policies are dealt with as follows:      The ultimate liability arising from claims made under insurance contracts       The main assumption underlying techniques applied in the estimation of this liability is that the company’s past claims experience can be       used to project future claims development and hence, ultimate claims costs. As such, these methods extrapolate the development of       paid and incurred losses, average costs per claim and claim numbers based on the observed development of earlier years and expected       loss ratios. Historical claims development is mainly analysed by accident years.       Additional qualitative judgment is used to assess the extent to which past trends may not apply in future, (for example to reflect one-off       occurrences, changes in external or market factors such as public attitudes to claiming, economic conditions, levels of claims’ inflation,       judicial decisions and legislation, as well as internal factors such as portfolio mix, policy conditions and claims handling procedures) in       order to arrive at the estimated ultimate cost of claims that present the likely outcome from the range of possible outcomes, taking       account of all the uncertainties involved. A margin for adverse deviation may also be included in the liability valuation.      Held-to-maturity investments       The company follows the guidance of IAS 39 in classifying non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and       fixed maturity as held-to-maturity. This classification requires significant judgement. In making this judgement, the company evaluates       its intention and ability to hold such investments to maturity. If the company fails to hold these investments to maturity other than for       the specific circumstances - for example, selling more than an insignificant amount close to maturity - it will be required to reclassify the       entire class as available-for-sale. The investments would therefore be measured at fair value not amortised cost.      ii) Key sources of estimation uncertainty      Impairment losses       At each reporting date, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is       any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is       estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an       individual asset, the company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.      Receivables       Critical estimates are made by the directors in determining the recoverable amount of receivables and valuation of investment property.      Valuation of investment properties       Estimates are made in determining valuations of investment properties. The management uses experts in determination of the values       to adopt.                                                                                                                                                                        47","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       STATEMENTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   2016  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   1 Incorporation and registered office        APA Insurance Limited is incorporated in Kenya under the Companies Act and is domiciled in Kenya. The address of its registered office is        Apollo Centre, 07 Ring Road, Parklands, Nairobi.   2 Risk management objectives and policies        The Company’s activities expose it to a variety of risks, including insurance risk, financial risk and credit risk. These risks result in changes        in property values, debt and equity market prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company’s’ overall risk        management programme focuses on the identification and management of risks and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on its        financial performance, by use of underwriting guidelines and capacity limits, reinsurance planning, credit policy governing the acceptance        of clients, and defined criteria for the approval of intermediaries and reinsurers. Investment policies are in place, which help manage        liquidity, and seek to maximise return within an acceptable level of interest rate risk.        The disclosures below summarise the way the company manages key risks:      2.1 Insurance risk        The risk under any one insurance contract arises from the possibility that the insured event occurs and the uncertainty of the amount of the        resulting claim. By the very nature of an insurance contract, this risk is random and therefore unpredictable.        For a portfolio of insurance contracts where the theory of probability is applied to pricing and provisioning, the principal risk that the        Company faces under its insurance contracts is that the actual claims and benefit payments exceed the carrying amount of the insurance        liabilities. This could occur because the frequency or severity of claims and benefits payable are greater than estimated. Insurance events        are random and the actual number and amount of claims and benefits payable will vary from year to year from the level established using        statistical techniques.        Experience shows that the larger the portfolio of similar insurance contracts, the smaller the relative variability of the expected outcome        will be. In addition, a more diversified portfolio is less likely to be affected across the board by a change in any subset of the portfolio.        The company has developed its insurance underwriting strategy to diversify the type of insurance risks accepted and within each of these        categories to achieve a sufficiently large population of risks to reduce the variability of the expected outcome.        Factors that aggravate insurance risk include lack of risk diversification in terms of type and amount of risk, geographical, local and type of        industry covered.

However, due to the time value of money and the impact of interest rates on the level of bodily injury incurred by thecompany’s policyholders (where a reduction of interest rate would normally produce a higher insurance liability), the company matches thecash flows of assets and liabilities in this portfolio by estimating their mean duration.The mean duration of liabilities is calculated using historical claims data to determine the expected settlement pattern for claims arisingfrom the insurance contracts in force at the reporting date (both incurred claims and future claims arising from the unexpired risks at thereporting date).                                                                                                                                                49","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                         AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                              STATEMENTS                                                                                                                          2016    NOTES TO THE    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)    2 Risk management objectives and policies (continued)      2.1 Insurance risk (continued)       The tables below show the contractual timing of cash flows arising from assets and liabilities included in the company’s Asset Liability       Management framework for management of short term insurance contracts as of 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015.

In particular, the key financial risk is that the proceeds from its financial assets are not sufficient to fund the obligations arising        from insurance policies as they fall due. The most important components of this financial risk are market risk (including interest rate risk,        equity price risk and currency risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. These risks arise from open positions in interest rate, currency and equity        products, all of which are exposed to general and specific market movements. The risks that the company primarily faces due to the nature        of its investments and liabilities are interest rate risk and equity price risk.        The company’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential        adverse effects on the company’s financial performance. It manages these positions with an Asset Liability Management (ALM) framework        that has been developed to achieve investment returns in excess of obligations under insurance contracts. The company produces regular        reports at portfolio and asset and liability class levels that are circulated to the company’s key management personnel. The principal        technique of the company’s ALM is to match assets to the liabilities arising from insurance contracts by reference to the type of benefits        payable to contract holders. The company’s ALM is also integrated with the management of the financial risks associated with the        company’s other financial assets and liabilities not directly associated with insurance and investment liabilities (in particular, borrowings        and investments in foreign operations). The company does not use hedge accounting. The company has not changed the processes used        to manage its risks from previous periods. The notes below explain how financial risks are managed using the categories utilised in the        company’s ALM framework.      (a) Market risk          (i) Interest rate risk        Interest rate risk arises primarily from investments in fixed interest securities and deposits with financial institutions. The sensitivity analysis        for interest rate risk illustrates how changes in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in        market interest rates at the reporting date. For financial instruments and insurance contracts described in this note, the sensitivity is solely        associated with the former, as the carrying amounts of the latter are not directly affected by changes in market risks.        The company’s management monitors the sensitivity of reported interest rate movements on a monthly basis by assessing the expected        changes in the different portfolios due to a parallel movement of plus 5 percentage points in all yield curves of financial assets and financial        liabilities. These particular exposures illustrate the company’s overall exposure to interest rate sensitivities included in the company’s ALM        framework and its impact on the company’s profit or loss.        An increase/decrease of 5 percentage points in interest yields would result in additional profit/loss for the period of Shs 397 million (2015:        Shs 345 million).          (ii) Price risk        The company is exposed to equity securities price risk as a result of its holdings in equity investments, classified as financial assets available        for sale. Exposures to equity shares in aggregate are monitored in order to ensure compliance with the relevant regulatory limits for        solvency purposes. Investments held are listed and traded on the Nairobi Securities Exchange.        Investment management meetings are held monthly. At these meetings, senior investment managers meet to discuss investment return        and concentration of the equity investments. Listed equity securities represent 71% (2015:77%) of total equity investments. If equity        market indices had increased/decreased by 5%, with all other variables held constant, and all the company’s equity investments moving        according to the historical correlation with the index, equity would have increased/decreased by Shs 75 million (2015: Shs105 million).          (iii) Foreign exchange risk        Foreign currency exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets and liabilities are denominated in a        currency that is not the company’s functional currency. Currently, management believes that there is minimal risk of significant losses due        to exchange rate fluctuations.52","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             STATEMENTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2016NOTES TO THEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)2 Risk management objectives and policies (continued)  2.2 Financial risk factors (continued)  (b) Credit risk   The company has exposure to credit risk, which is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due. Key areas   where the company is exposed to credit risk are:       •	 reinsurers’ share of insurance liabilities and reserves;       •	 amounts due from reinsurers in respect of claims already paid;       •	 amounts due from insurance contract holders;       •	 amounts due from insurance intermediaries;       •	 amounts due from corporate bond issuers;       •	 cash and deposits held with banks and       •	 rental receivables   The company manages the levels of credit risk it accepts by placing limits on its exposure to a single counterparty, or Companys of   counterparties and to geographical and industry segments. Such risks are subject to regular reviews. Reinsurance is used to manage   insurance risk. This does not, however, discharge the company’s liability as primary insurer. If a reinsurer fails to pay a claim, the company   remains liable for the payment to the policyholder. The creditworthiness of reinsurers is considered on annual basis by reviewing their   financial strength prior to finalisation of annual contracts.   In addition, management assesses the credit worthiness of all reinsurers and intermediaries by reviewing credit grades provided by rating   agencies and other publicly available financial information. The recent payment history of reinsurers is also used to update the reinsurance   purchasing strategy. The exposure to individual counterparties is also managed through other mechanisms such as the right of offset   where counterparties are both debtors and creditors of the company. Management information reported to the directors include details of   provisions for impairment on receivables and subsequent write offs. Exposures to individual policyholders and Companys of policyholders   are collected within the on-going monitoring of the controls associated with regulatory solvency. Where there exists significant exposure   to individual policyholders, or homogenous Companys of policyholders, a financial analysis is carried out by the management.   The amount that best represents the Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk as at 31 December 2016 is made up as follows:                                                                      Fully  Past due     Impaired         Total                                                             performing       but not      Shs’000     Shs’000                                                                  Shs’000    impaired                                                                              Shs’000Government securities                                        6,548,144                 -

Receivables in the impaired category are fully provided for and they continue being pursued for    settlement.    (c) Liquidity risk    Liquidity risk is the risk that cash may not be available to pay obligations when due at a reasonable cost. The primary liquidity risk of the    company is the obligation to pay claims to policyholders as they fall due. The projected settlement of these liabilities is modelled, on a    regular basis, using actuarial techniques. The board sets limits on the minimum proportion of maturing funds available to meet such calls    and on the minimum level of borrowing facilities that should be in place to cover anticipated liabilities and unexpected levels of demand.

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. A market is    regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry Company, pricing service,    or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. The quoted    market price used for financial assets held by the company is the current bid price. These instruments are included in level 1. Instruments    included in level 1 comprise primarily Nairobi Securities Exchange (“NSE”) equity investments and government bonds classified as available    for sale.    The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by    using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as    possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included    in level 2.    If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.    Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include       •	 Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments       •	 The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield              curves.       •	 The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date, with              the resulting value discounted back to present value.    Other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.    There was no movement in level 3 during the year.56","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             STATEMENTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2016NOTES TO THEFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)2 Risk management objectives and policies (continued)  2.3 Capital management   The company maintains an efficient capital structure consistent with the company’s risk profile and the regulatory and market requirements   of its business.   The company’s objectives in managing its capital are:       •	 to match the profile of its assets and liabilities taking account of the risks inherent in the business;       •	 to maintain financial strength to support business growth;       •	 to satisfy the requirements of its policyholders, regulators and rating agencies;       •	 to retain financial flexibility by maintaining strong liquidity and access to a range of capital markets       •	 to allocate capital efficiently to support growth       •	 to safeguard the company’s ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and              benefits for other stakeholders; and       •	 to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing insurance contracts commensurately with the level of risk.   An important aspect of the company’s overall capital management process is the setting of a target risk-adjusted rate of return which is   aligned to performance objectives and ensures that the company is focused on the creation of value for shareholders.   The company has a number of sources of capital available to it and seeks to optimise its equity/debt structure in order to ensure that   it can consistently maximise returns to shareholders. The company considers not only the traditional sources of capital funding but the   alternative sources of capital including reinsurance, as appropriate, when assessing its deployment and usage of capital. The company   manages as capital, all items that are eligible to be treated as such for regulatory purposes.   The Company is regulated by the Insurance Regulatory Authority in Kenya. The Insurance Act Requires each insurance company to hold   the minimum level of paid up capital for general insurance companies at the minimum amount of Shs 300 Million (Shs 600 million by 30th   June 2018).   General insurance businesses are required to keep a solvency margin, i.e. admitted assets less admitted liabilities, equivalent to the higher   of Shs 10 million or 15% of the net premium income during the preceding financial year.   The solvency margin of the Company as at 31 December 2016 and 2015 is illustrated below.Admitted assets           2016        2015Admitted liabilities  Shs’000     Shs’000Margin                      14,351,223  13,320,136Required margin       11,312,467  10,794,354                       3,038,756   2,525,782                       1,048,968      868,760                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               57","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                               AND FINANCIAL                                                                                    STATEMENTS                                                                                                2016    NOTES TO THE    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)    2 Risk management objectives and policies (continued)      2.3 Capital management (continued)       The constitution of capital managed by the Company is as shown below:                                                                                 2016                    2015                                                                              Shs’000                 Shs’000    Share capital                                                             1,250,000               1,250,000    Investment revaluation reserve                                              222,886                 490,549    Translation reserve                                                          (27,910)                (25,123)    Retained earnings    Proposed dividends                                                        3,618,039               3,168,461                                                                                200,000                           -    Total attributable to equity holders                                                                              5,263,015               4,883,887    3 Gross earned premium       The company underwrites general insurance business only.

This reserve is           non-distributable. Where a revalued financial asset is sold, the portion of the reserve that relates to that financial asset, and is effectively           realised, is recognised in profit and loss.           Where a revalued financial asset is impaired, the portion of the reserve that relates to that financial asset is recognised in profit and loss.

The directors are of the opinion that the outstanding litigation in this respect will not have a material effect on the financial position or       profits of the company.       The company is aware that Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has made claims on the players in insurance industry in respect of certain       taxes, which have been subject of intense negotiations between all the stakeholders. Based on the available information including expert       opinions received and ongoing stakeholder discussions, the directors are of the opinion that there still exists uncertainty as regards some       of the taxes and accordingly no provision has been made for these taxes until the matter is clarified or fully concluded.       The Company has issued financial guarantees against counter indemnities from third parties for an aggregate outstanding exposure of       Shs. 45,000,000 as at 31 December 2016 (2015: Shs. 13,538,000).
