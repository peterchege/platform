Reasonableassurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will alwaysdetect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken onthe basis of these financial statements.As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticismthroughout the audit. We also:•	 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design    and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to    provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than    for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the    override of internal control.•	 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate    in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal    control.•	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related    disclosures made by the Directors.•	 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit    evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant    doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we    are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such    disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the    date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a    going concern.•	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and    whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair    presentation.We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit andsignificant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regardingindependence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bearon our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.                                                                                                                                                                          13","ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL      STATEMENTS                  2017  INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  TO THE DIRECTORS OF APA  INSURANCE (UGANDA) LIMITED    Responsibilities of directors for the financial statements (Continued)    Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (Continued)     From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the     audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters     in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare     circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences     of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

We confirm that:     •	 We have obtained all the information and explanations which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, were necessary        for the purposes of our audit;     •	 In our opinion proper books of account have been kept by the Company, so far as appears from our examination of those        books; and     •	 The Company’s statement of financial position and statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income are in        agreement with the books of account.

The Company is licensed to     transact general insurance business as defined by the Insurance Act (CAP 213). The Company is wholly owned by Apollo     Investments limited incorporated in Kenya.    2 Summary of significant accounting policies     The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These     policies have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.    a) Basis of preparation     The financial statements are prepared in accordance with and comply with International Financial Reporting Standards. The     financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the carrying of investment property     and available-for-sale investments at fair value, impaired assets at their recoverable amounts, and actuarially determined     liabilities at their present value. The financial statements are presented in Uganda Shillings (Ushs), rounded to the nearest     thousand.     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of     estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and     liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting     period. Although these estimates are based on the directors’ best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results     ultimately may differ from those estimates. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or where     assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in Note 3.    b) Application of new and revised international financial reporting standards (IFRS’s)     Section 1A: Amendments to IFRSs that are mandatorily effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January     2017     The amendments generally require full retrospective application (i.e. comparative amounts have to be restated), with     some amendments requiring retrospective application.     • Amendments to IAS 7 disclosure initiative;     • Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for unrealised losses; and     • Amendments to IFRS 12 included in Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014 – 2016 cycle.     Amendments to IAS 7 disclosure initiate (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017)     The amendments require an entity to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes     in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both cash and non-cash changes.     The amendments apply prospectively. Entities are not required to present comparative information for earlier periods     when they first apply the amendments.24","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                         AND FINANCIAL                                                                                         STATEMENTS                                                                                         2017NOTES TO THEFINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 20172 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)(b) Application of new and revised international financial reporting standards (IFRS’s) (continued)Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses (effective for annual periods beginningon or after 1 January 2017)The amendments clarify the following:1. Unrealised losses on a debt instrument measured at fair value for which the tax base remains at cost given rise   a deductible temporary difference, irrespective of whether the debt instrument’s holders expects to recover the   carrying amount of the debt instrument by sale or by use, or whether it is probable that the issuer will pay all the   contractual cash flows;2. When an entity assesses whether taxable profits will be available against which it can utilise a deductible temporary   difference, and the tax law restricts the utilisation of losses to deduction against income of a specific type (e.g.   capital losses can only be set off against capital gains), an entity assesses a deductible temporary difference   in combination with other deductible temporary differences of that type, but separately from other types of   deductible temporary differences;3. The estimate of probable future taxable profit may include the recover of some of an entity’s assets for more than   their carrying amount if there is sufficient evidence that it is probable that the entity will achieve this;4. In evaluating whether sufficient future taxable profits are available, an entity should compare the deductible   temporary differences with future table profits excluding tax deductions resulting from the reversal of those   deductible temporary differences.The amendments apply retrospectively.Amendments to IFRS 12 included in the 2014 – 2016 annual improvements cycle (effective for annual periodsbeginning on or after 1 January 2017)The 2014 – 2016 annual improvements cycle includes amendments to an number of IFRSs, one of thich is effective forannual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (as revised in 2014) (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018)     In July 2014, the IASB finalised the reform of financial instruments accounting and issued IFRS 9 (as revised in 2014),     which contains the requirements for a) the classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, b)     impairment methodology, and c) general hedge accounting. IFRS 9 (as revised in 2014) will supersede IAS 39 Financial     Instruments: Recognition and Measurement upon its effective date.    Phase 1: Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities     With respect to the classification and measurement, the number of categories of financial assets under IFRS 9has been     reduced, all recognised financial assets that are currently within the scope of IAS 39 will be subsequently measured at     either amortised cost or fair value under IFRS 9. Specifically:     • 	A debt instrument that (i) is held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows and        (ii) has contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding        must be measured at amortised cost (net of any write down for impairment), unless the asset is designated at fair        value though profit or loss (FVTPL) under the fair value option.     • 	Debt instrument that (i) is held within a business model whose objective is achieved both by collecting contractual        cash flows and selling financial assets and (ii) has contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that        are solely payments of a principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding must be measured at FVTOCL,        unless the asset is designated at FVTPL under the fair value option.     • 	All other debt instruments must be measured at FVTPL.     • 	All equity investments are to be measured in the statement of financial position at fair value, with gains and losses        recognised in profit or loss except that if an equity investment is not held for trading, nor contingent consideration        recognised by an acquirer in a business combination to which IFRS 3 applies, an irrevocable election can be made at        initial recognition to measure the investment at FVTOCI, with dividend income recognised in profit or loss. 26","ANNUAL REPORT                                     AND FINANCIAL                                     STATEMENTS                                     2017NOTES TO THEFINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 20172 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)(b) Application of new and revised international financial reporting standards (IFRS’s) (continued)Phase 1: Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilitiesIFRS 9 also contains requirements for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities and derecognitionrequirements. One major change from IAS 39 relates to the presentation of changes in the fair value of a financialliability designated as at FVTPL attributable to changes in the credit risk or that liability. Under IFRS 9, such changesare presented in other comprehensive income, unless the presentation of the effect of the change in the liability’scredit risk in other comprehensive income would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss.Changes in fair value attributable to a financial liability’s credit risk are not subsequently reclassified to profit orloss. Under IAS 39, the entire amount of the change in the fair value of the financial liability designated as FVTPL ispresented in profit or loss.Phase 2: Impairment of financial assetsThe impairment model under IFRS 9 reflects expected credit losses, as opposed to incurred credit losses under IAS 39.Under the impairment approach in IFRS 9, it is no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before creditlosses are recognised. Instead, an entity always accounts for expected credit losses and changes in those expectedcredit losses. The amount of expected credit losses should be updated at each reporting date to reflect changes incredit risk since initial recognition.Phase 3: Hedge accountingThe general hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9 retain the three types of hedge accounting mechanisms in IAS 39.However, greater flexibility has been introduced to the types of transactions eligible for hedge accounting, specificallybroadening the types of instruments that qualify as hedging instruments and the types of risk components of non-financial items that are eligible for hedge accounting. In addition, the effectiveness is no longer required. For moredisclosure requirements about an entity’s risk management activities have been traduced.The work on macro hedging by the IASB is still at a preliminary stage – a discussion paper was issued in April 2014together preliminary views and direction from constituents with a comment period which ended in October 2014. Theproject is still under analysis at the time of writing.Transitional provisionsIFRS 9 (as revised in 2014) is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with earlier applicationpermitted. If an entity elects to apply IFRS 9 at the same time, except for those relating to:1. The presentation of fair value gains and losses attributable to changes in the credit risk of financial liabilities    designated as at FVTPL, the requirements for which an entity may early apply without applying the other    requirements in IFRS 9; and2. Hedge accounting, for which an entity may choose to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS    39 instead of the requirements of IFRS 9.IFRS 9 contains specific transitional provisions for i) classification and measurement of financial assets; ii) impairmentof financial assets; and iii) hedge accounting. Please see IFRS 9 for details.The Directors of the Company anticipate that the application of IFRS 9 in the future may have an impact on the amountsreported and disclosures made in the financial statements. However, it is not practicable to provide a reasonableestimate of the effect of IFRS 9 until the Company performs a detailed review.                                                                                                                            27","ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL      STATEMENTS                  2017  NOTES TO THE  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 20172 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)(b) Application of new and revised international financial reporting standards (IFRS’s) (continued)Transitional provisions (continued)IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018)IFRS 15 establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contractswith customers. It will supersede the following revenue Standards and Interpretations upon its effective date:• IAS 18 Revenue;• IAS 11 Construction Contracts;• IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes;• IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate;• IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers; and• SIC 13 Revue-Barter Transactions involving advertising servicesAs suggested by the title of the new Revenue Standard, IFRS 15 will only cover revenue arising from contracts withcustomers. Under IFRS 15, a customer of an entity is a party that has contracted with the entity to obtain goods orservices that are an output of the entity’s activities in exchange for consideration. Unlike the scope of IAS 18, therecognition and measurement of interest income and dividend income from debt and equity investments are no longerwithin the scope of IFRS 15. Instead, they are within the scope of IAS 39 (or IFRS 9 if it is early adopted).As mentioned above, the new Revenue Standard has a single model to deal with revenue from contracts with customers.Its core principle is that an entity should recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services tocustomers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for thosegoods or services.The new Revenue Standard introduces a 5 step approach to revenue recognition and measurement:                      STEP 2                                       STEP 4STEP 1                       Identify the                          Allocate the                             performance                           transaction       Identify the          obligations in                        price to the       contract with         the contract                          performance       a customer                                             STEP 3                              STEP 5                                                    Determine the                       Recognise                                                    transaction                         revenue when                                                    price                               (or as) the                                                                                        entity satisﬁes    Far more prescriptive guidance has been introduced by the new Revenue Standard:    •	 Whether or not a contract (or a combination of contracts) contains more than one promised good or service, and if       so, when and how the promised goods or services should be unbundled.    •	 Whether the transaction process allocated to each performance obligation should be recognised as revenue over       time or at a point in time. Under IFRS 15, an entity recognises revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied,       which is when ‘control’ of the goods or services underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to       the customer. Unlike IA 18 , the new Standard does not include separate guidance for ‘sale of goods’ and ‘provision       of services’’ rather’ the new Standard requires entities to assess whether revenue should be recognised over time or       a particular point in time regardless of whether revenue relates to ‘sales of goods ‘ or ‘provision of services’.28","ANNUAL REPORT                                     AND FINANCIAL                                     STATEMENTS                                     2017NOTES TO THEFINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 20172 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)(b) Application of new and revised international financial reporting standards (IFRS’s) (continued)Transitional provisions (continued)•	 When the transaction price includes a variable consideration element, how it will affect the amount and timing of   revenue to be recognised. The concept of variable consideration is broad; a transaction price is considered variable   due to discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price concessions, incentives, performance bonuses, penalties and   contingency arrangements. The new standard introduces a high hurdle for variable consideration to be recognised as   revenue – that is, only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversals in the amount of cumulative   revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently   resolved.• 	When costs incurred to obtain a contact and costs to fulfil a contract can be recognised as an asset. In April 2016,   the IASB issued clarifications to IFRS 15 in response to feedback received by the IASB/FASB Joint Transition Resource   Group for Revenue Recognition, which was formed to address potential issues associated with the implementation   of IFRS 15 and the US GAAP equivalent, ASC topic 606. The Clarification to IFRS 15 clarified the following areas:•	 Identify performance obligations; by providing illustrative factors for consideration in assessing whether the   promised goods or services are distinct.•	 Principal versus agent considerations; by clarifying that an entity should assess whether it is a principal or agent   for each distinct good or service promised to the customer, and by amending and reframing the indicators to assess   whether an entity is a principal or agent; and•	 Licensing application guidance: in determining whether the license grants customers a right to use the underlying   intellectual property (“IP”) (which would result in point in time revenue recognition) or a right to access the IP   (which would result in revenue recognition over time), an entity is required to determine whether (i) its ongoing   activities are expected to significantly change the form or the functionality of the IP or (ii) the ability to the   customer to obtain benefit from the IP is substantially derived from or dependent upon those activities.Many entities across different industries will likely be affected by IFRS (at least to a certain extent). In some cases,the changes may be substantial and may require changes to the existing IT systems and internal controls entitiesshould consider the nature and extent of these changes.for additional information, please refer to the Deloitte publications IFRS in focus and IFRS industry insights whichhighlight the practical implications of IFTRS 15 to various industries.

Entities can choose to apply the Standard retrospectivelyor to use a modified transition approach, which is to apply the standard retrospectively only to contracts that are notcompleted contracts at the date of initial application (for example, 1 January 2018 for an entity with a 31 Decemberyear-end). The clarifications to IFRS also introduces additional practical expedients for entities transition to IFRS 15on (i) contracts modifications that occurred prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and (ii) contractsthat were completed at the beginning of the earliest period presented.The Directors are still in the process of assessing the full impact of the application of IFRS 15 on the company financialstatements and it is not practicable to provide a reasonable financial estimate of the effect until the Directorscomplete the detailed review. As a result the above preliminary assessment is subject to change. The Directors donot intend to early apply the standard and intend to use the full retrospective method upon adoption.                                                                                                                              29","ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL      STATEMENTS                  2017  NOTES TO THE  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017    2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)    (b) Application of new and revised international financial reporting standards (IFRS’s) (continued)    Transitional provisions (continued)     IFRS 16 Leases (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019).     IFRS 16 provides a comprehensive model for the identification of lease arrangements and their treatment in the financial     statements of both lessees and lessors. It will supersede the following lease standard and interpretations upon its     effective date:     • IAS 17 leases;     • IFRIC 4 determining whether an arrangement contains a lease;     • SIC-15 operating leases – incentives; and     • SIC -27 evaluating the substance of transactions involving the legal form of a lease.    Identification of a lease     IFRS 16 applies a control model to the identification of leases, distinguishing between leases and service transactions     on the basis of whether there is an identified asset controlled by the customer. Control is considered to exist if the     customer has:     a) The right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of an identified asset, and     b) The right to direct the use of that asset.     The standard provides detailed guidance to determine whether those conditions are met, including instances where the     supplier has substantive substitution rights, and where the relevant decisions about how and for what purpose the asset     is used are predetermined.    Lessee accounting     IFRS 16 introduces significant changes to leases accounting: it removes the distinction between operating and finance     leases under IAS 17 and requires a lessee to recorgnise a riht – of – use asset and a lease liability at lease commencement     for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases if low value assets.     The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost (subject to certain exceptions)     less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability.     The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date.     Subsequently, the lease liability is adjusted for interest and lease payments, as well as the impact of lease modifications,     amongst others.     If a lessee elects not to apply the general requirements of IFRS 16 to short-term leases (i.e. one that does not include     a purchase option and had a lease tern at commencement date of 12 months or less) and leases if low value assets, the     lessee should recorgnise the lease payments associated with those leases as an expense on either a straight-line basis     over the lease term or another systematic basis, similar to the current accounting for operating leases.    Lessor accounting     In contrast to lessee accounting, the IFRS 16 lessor accounting requirements remain largely unchanged from IAS 17,     which continue to require a lessor to classify a lease either as an operating lease or a finance lease.     In addition, IFRS 16 also provides guidance on the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions. Extensive disclosure     are also required by the new Standard.     The application of these amendments is not expected to result in any impact on the financial performance or financial     positon of the company.30","ANNUAL REPORT                                     AND FINANCIAL                                     STATEMENTS                                     2017NOTES TO THEFINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 20172 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)(b) Application of new and revised international financial reporting standards (IFRS’s) (continued)Lessor accounting (continued)Due to the prominence of leasing transactions in the economy, many entities across different industries will beaffected by IFRS 16.

A lessee can apply IFRS 16 either bya full retrospective approach of a modified retrospective approach.

In estimating the fair value of cash-settled share-based payment, the accounting for the effects pf vesting and non-   vesting conditions should follow the same approach as for equity-settled share-based payments.2. Where tax law or regulations requires an entity to withhold a specified number of equity instruments equals to the   monetary value of the employee’s tax obligation to meet the employee’s tax liability which is then remitted to the   tax authority (typically in cash), i.e. the share-based payment arrangement has a net settlement feature such an   arrangement should be classified as equity-settled in its entirely, provided that the share-based payment would   have been classified as equity-settled had it not included the net settlement feature.3. A modification of a share-based payment that changes the transaction from cash-settled to equity-settled should   be accounted for as follows:   i.	 The original liability is derecognised   ii.	 The equity-settled share-based payment is recognised at the modification date fair value of the equity instrument        granted to the extent that services have been rendered up to the modification date; and   iii.	 Any difference between the carrying amount of the liability at the modification date and the amount recognised        in equity should be recognised in profit or loss immediately.The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with earlier applicationpermitted. Specific transition provisions apply.The application of these amendments is not expected to result in any impact on the financial performance or financialpositon of the company.                                                                                                                           31","ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL      STATEMENTS                  2017  NOTES TO THE  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017    2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)    (b) Application of new and revised international financial reporting standards (IFRS’s) (continued)     Amendments of IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an investor and its Associate or Joint     Venture     (Effective for annual periods beginning on or after a date to be determined)     The amendments deal with situations where there is a sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its     associate or joint venture IAS 28 and IFRS 10 are amended, as follows:     IAS 28 has been amended to reflect the following:     •	 Gains and losses resulting from transactions involving assets that do not constitute a business between an investor        and its associate or joint venture are recognised to the extent of unrelated investors’ interest in the associate or joint        venture.     •	 Gains and losses from downstream transactions involving assets that constitute a business between an investor and its        associate or joint venture should be recognised in full in the investor’s financial statements.     •	 Gains or losses resulting from the loss of control of a subsidiary that does not contain a business in a transaction with        an associate or a joint venture that is accounted for using the equity method, are recognised in the parent’s profit        or loss only to the extent of the unrelated investors’ interests in that associate or joint venture. Similarly, gains and        losses resulting from the measurement or investments retained in any former subsidiary (that has become an associate        or a joint venture that is accounted for using the equity method) to fair value are recognised in the former parent’s        profit or loss only to the extent of the unrelated investors’ interests in the new associate or joint venture.     In December 2015, the IASB postponed the effective date amendment indefinitely pending the outcome of its research     project on the equity method of accounting. Earlier application of these amendments is still permitted.     The application of these amendments is not expected to result in any impact on the financial performance or financial     positon of the company.    Amendments to IAS 40 Transfers Investment Property    (Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018)     The amendments clarify that a transfer to, or from, investment property necessitates an assessment of whether a     property meets, or has ceased to meet the definition of investment property supported by observable evidence that     a change in use has occurred. The amendments further clarify that the situations listed in IAS 40 are not exhaustive     and that a change in use is possible for properties under construction (i.e. a change in use is not limited to completed     properties.)     The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with earlier application     permitted. Entities can apply the amendments either retrospectively (if this is possible without the use of hindsight) or     prospectively. Specific transition provisions apply.

If there aremultiple payments or receipts in advance, the Interpretation requires an entity to determine the date of transaction foreach payment or receipt of advance consideration.The Interpretation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with earlier application permitted.Entities can apply the Interpretation either retrospectively or prospectively.

Unearned premium represent the proportion of the premium written in periodsup to the accounting date that relate to the unexpired terms of policies in force at the statement of financial positiondate, and is calculated on the 1/365 method on written premium less reinsurance premium ceded. This is a change fromthe 1/24 method used in prior year. The Directors are of the opinion that the use of the 1/365 method provides a moreaccurate way of deferring unearned premiums.Commissions receivable are recognised as income in the period in which they are earned.Investment income is stated net of investment expenses. Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis thattakes into account the effective yield on the asset.                                                                                                                              33","ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL      STATEMENTS                  2017    NOTES TO THE    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017	 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)    (d) Claims incurred    	 Claims incurred comprise claims paid in the year and changes in the provision for outstanding claims. Claims paid          represent all payments made during the year, whether arising from events during that or earlier years. Outstanding          claims represent the estimated ultimate cost of settling all claims arising from incidents occurring prior to the          statement of financial position date, but not settled at that date. Outstanding claims are computed on the basis          of the best information available at the time the records for the year are closed, and include provisions for claims          incurred but not reported (“IBNR”). Outstanding claims are not discounted.    (e) Commissions payable and deferred acquisition costs    	 A proportion of commission payable is deferred and amortised over the period in which the related premiums are          earned. Deferred acquisition costs represent a proportion of acquisition costs that relate to policies that are in          force at the year end.    (f) Property and equipment    	 All items of property and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, property and equipment is stated          at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and/or accumulated impairment losses, if any.    	 Depreciation is calculated on other property and equipment on the straight line basis to write down the cost of each          asset, or the revalued amount, to its residual value over its estimated useful life as follows:	    Furniture, fixtures and fittings and office equipment		     8 years    Motor vehicles						                                        4 years    Computer equipment						                                    3 years    Intangible Assets                                        	  3 years    Assets’ residual values and their estimated useful lives are reviewed at each statement of financial position date and    adjusted if appropriate.    Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it iswritten down    immediately to its recoverable amount.    Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are determined by reference to their carrying amounts.    Upon disposal of revalued assets, amounts in the revaluation surplus relating to that asset are transferred to retained    earnings.    (g)	 Financial assets    	 The company classifies its financial assets into the following categories; financial assets at fair value through profit          or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity financial assets and available-for-sale financial assets.    	 The classification adopted for a particular investment depends on the purpose for which the investment was          acquired. Management determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this          at every reporting date.          i) Financial assets at fair values through profit or loss (“FVTPL”)					          This category has two sub-categories: financial assets held for trading and those designated at fair value through          profit or loss at inception. A financial asset is classified into this category at inception if acquired principally for the          purpose of selling in the short term, if it forms part of a portfolio of financial asset in which there is evidence of          short term profit-taking or if so designated by management.34","ANNUAL REPORT                                                          AND FINANCIAL                                                          STATEMENTS                                                          2017NOTES TO THEFINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 20172 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)(g) Financial assets (continued)ii) Loans and receivables	  	Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quotedin an active market other than those that the company intends to sell in the short term or those that it hasdesignated as at fair value through profit or loss or available-for-sale. Receivables arising from insurance contractsare also classified in this category and are reviewed for impairment as part of the impairment review of loans andreceivables.iii) Held-to-maturity financial assets		Held-to-maturity financial assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixedmaturities – other than those that meet the definition of loans and receivables – that the company’s managementhas the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity.iv) Available-for-sale financial assets	This classification represents financial assets that are not (a) financial assets at fair value through profit or loss,(b) loans and receivables, or (c) financial assets held to maturity.	v) Recognition of financial assets		Financial assets are initially recognized at fair value plus transaction costs. Financial assets are derecognizedwhen the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the company has transferredsubstantially all risk and rewards of ownership.Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carriedat fair value. Loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortized cost using theeffective interest method. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of “financial assets at fair valuethrough profit or loss” are dealt with in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Gains and lossesarising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are recognized directly in equity, untilthe financial asset is derecognized or impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognizes inequity is recognized in the income statement.vi) Effective interest methodThe effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial asset and of allocatinginterest income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimatedcash receipts (including all fees, transaction costs and premiums or discounts) through the expected life of thefinancial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.vii) Impairment of financial assetsFinancial assets, other than those at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment ateach statement of financial position date. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that,as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimatedfuture cash flows of the investment have been impacted.Objective evidence of impairment for receivables could include the company’s past experience of collectingpayments, an increase in the number of delayed payments past the average credit period, as well as observablechanges in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.                                                                                                                         35","ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL      STATEMENTS                  2017  NOTES TO THE  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017    2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)    (g) Financial assets (continued)          vii) impairment of financial assets (continued)          The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with          the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.          When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent          recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying          amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.          viii) Derecognition of financial assets          The Company derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset          expire; or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to          another entity. If the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership          and continues to control the transferred asset, the company recognises its retained interest in the asset and an          associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the company retains substantially all the risks and rewards          of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Company continues to recognise the financial asset and also          recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.    (h) Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the company          Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance          of the contractual arrangement.        Classification as debt or equity          An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting          all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct          issue costs.        Financial liabilities          Financial liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities.        Other financial liabilities          Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs and are          subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on          an effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial          liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that          exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where          appropriate, a shorter period.        Derecognition of financial liabilities          The Company derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company’s obligations are discharged,          cancelled or they expire.    (i) Cash and cash equivalents          Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid          investments with original maturities of three months or less, and company overdrafts. Company overdrafts are          included in current liabilities in the statement of financial position.    (j) Translation of foreign currencies           Transactions in foreign currencies during the year are converted into Uganda Shillings at rates ruling at the transaction           dates. Assets and liabilities at the statement of financial position date which are expressed in foreign currencies           are translated into Uganda Shillings at rates ruling at that date. The resulting differences from conversion and           translation are dealt with in the statement of comprehensive income in the year in which they arise.36","ANNUAL REPORT                                     AND FINANCIAL                                     STATEMENTS                                     2017NOTES TO THEFINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 20172 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)(k) Accounting for leases     Leases of assets where a significant proportion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the company     as a lessee are classified as finance leases. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Payments made     under operating leases are charged to income on the straight-line basis over the term of the lease.(l) Employee entitlements     Employee entitlements to long service awards are recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made     for the estimated liability for such entitlements as a result of services rendered by employees up to the statement     of financial position date. The estimated monetary liability for employees’ accrued annual leave entitlement at     the statement of financial position date is recognised as an expense accrual.(m) Income tax     Tax expense / (income) comprise of current tax and deferred tax. Tax is recognised as an expense / (income) and     included in the statement of comprehensive income, except to the extent that the tax arises from a transaction     which is recognised directly in equity.     Current tax is computed in accordance with the Ugandan income tax laws applicable to insurance companies.     Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of     assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes. Tax rates enacted or substantively     enacted at the statement of financial position date are used to determine deferred tax.     Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be     available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset     when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities.(n) Retirement benefit obligations      The company contributes to the statutory defined contribution pension scheme, the National Social Security Fund      (NSSF). Contributions to this scheme are determined by local statute and are currently at 10% of the gross pay      for every employee per month. The company’s obligations to these schemes are charged to the statement of      comprehensive income as they fall due.(o) Liability adequacy test     At each balance sheet date, liability adequacy tests are performed in order to ensure the adequacy     of the contract liabilities net of related deferred acquisition costs and deferred policyholders’ participation     liability or asset. To perform these tests, the entity uses the chain ladder technique to estimate the ultimate     costs of claims and IBNR provision. The weighted average of past claim development is projected into the future.     The projection is based on the ratios of cumulative past claims, usually paid or incurred, for successive years     of development. The technique requires the earliest year of origin to be fully run-off or at least that the final     outcome for that year can be estimated with confidence. If appropriate, the method can be applied to past claims     data that have been explicitly adjusted for past inflation.     Any identified deficiency is charged to the income statement, initially by respectively writing off deferred     acquisition costs and subsequently by establishing a liability adequacy test provision for losses arising from the     liability adequacy test for any amount in excess of the Insurance contract liabilities.(p) Dividend distribution     Dividend distributions to the company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the company’s financial     statements in the year in which the dividends are approved by the shareholders.(q) Comparatives     Comparative figures for the previous year are given alongside the figures for the current period.                                                                                                                            37","ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL      STATEMENTS                  2017  NOTES TO THE  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017    2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)    (r) Contingency reserve          The contingency reserve is set up under Section 47(2) (c) of the Insurance Statute 1996. The reserve is provided          for at the greater of 2% of the gross premium income and 15% of net profit each year effective from 1996, and is          required to accumulate until it reaches the greater of either minimum paid-up capital or fifty per cent of the net          premium written.    (s) Capital base growth fund          The capital base reserve is set up as a requirement under the Insurance Act, CAP 213, under which every insurer          should transfer from its profits every year, before any dividend is declared and after tax provision, 5% of its profits,          which will subsequently be transferred to the paid up capital.    3 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty          In the process of applying the entity’s accounting policies, management has made estimates and assumptions that          affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Estimates and judgments are          continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future          events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.       (a). Critical judgments in applying the entity’s accounting policies          The key areas of judgment in applying the entity’s accounting policies are dealt with as follows:        i. The ultimate liability arising from claims made under insurance contracts          The main assumption underlying techniques applied in the estimation of this liability is that a company’s past claims          experience can be used to project future claims development and hence ultimate claims costs. As such, these          methods extrapolate the development of paid and incurred losses, average costs per claim and claim numbers based          on the observed development of earlier years and expected loss ratios. Historical claims development is mainly          analysed by accident years. Additional qualitative judgment is used to assess the extent to which past trends may          not apply in future, (for example to reflect one-off occurrences, changes in external or market factors such as          public attitudes to claiming, economic conditions, levels of claims inflation, judicial decisions and legislation, as          well as internal factors such as portfolio mix, policy conditions and claims handling procedures) in order to arrive          at the estimated ultimate cost of claims that present the likely outcome from the range of possible outcomes,          taking account of all the uncertainties involved. A margin for adverse deviation may also be included in the liability          valuation.       (b). Key sources of estimation uncertainty          The disclosures below summarise the way the company manages key risks:        i. Impairment losses          At each statement of financial position date, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible          assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.          If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent          of the impairment loss. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the          Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.        ii. Property and equipment          Critical estimates are made by the Company’s management, in determining depreciation rates for property and          equipment.38","ANNUAL REPORT                                     AND FINANCIAL                                     STATEMENTS                                     2017NOTES TO THEFINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 20174 Risk Management objectives and policies     The company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including insurance risk, financial risk, credit risk,     and the effects of changes in property values, debt and equity market prices, foreign currency exchange rates and     interest rates. The company’s overall risk management programme focuses on the identification and management     of risks and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on its financial performance, by use of underwriting     guidelines and capacity limits, reinsurance planning, credit policy governing the acceptance of clients, and defined     criteria for the approval of intermediaries and reinsurers. Investment policies are in place, which help manage     liquidity, and seek to maximise return within an acceptable level of interest rate risk.4.1 Insurance risk     The risk under any one insurance contract arises from the possibility that the insured event occurs and the     uncertainty of the amount of the resulting claim. By the very nature of an insurance contract, this risk is random     and therefore unpredictable.     For a portfolio of insurance contracts where the theory of probability is applied to pricing and provisioning, the     principal risk that the company faces under its insurance contracts is that the actual claims and benefit payments     exceed the carrying amount of the insurance liabilities. This could occur because the frequency or severity of     claims and benefits payable are greater than estimated. Insurance events are random and the actual number     and amount of claims and benefits payable will vary from year to year from the level established using statistical     techniques.     Experience shows that the larger the portfolio of similar insurance contracts, the smaller the relative variability     of the expected outcome will be. In addition, a more diversified portfolio is less likely to be affected across the     board by a change in any subset of the portfolio. The company has developed its insurance underwriting strategy     to diversify the type of insurance risks accepted and within each of these categories to achieve a sufficiently large     population of risks to reduce the variability of the expected outcome.     Factors that aggravate insurance risk include lack of risk diversification in terms of type and amount of risk,     geographical, local and type of industry covered4.2 Financial risk     The company is exposed to a range of financial risks through its financial assets, financial liabilities, reinsurance     assets and insurance liabilities. In particular, the key financial risk is that the proceeds from its financial assets     are not sufficient to fund the obligations arising from insurance policies as they fall due. The most important     components of this financial risk are market risk (including interest rate risk, equity price risk and currency risk),     credit risk and liquidity risk.     These risks arise from open positions in interest rate, currency and equity products, all of which are exposed     to general and specific market movements. The risks that the company primarily faces due to the nature of its     investments and liabilities are interest rate risk and equity price risk.     The company’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks     to minimise potential adverse effects on the company’s financial performance. It manages these positions with an     Asset Liability Management (ALM) framework that has been developed to achieve investment returns in excess of     obligations under insurance contracts.     The company produces regular reports at portfolio and asset and liability class level that are circulated to the     company’s key management personnel. The principal technique of the company’s ALM is to match assets to the     liabilities arising from insurance contracts by reference to the type of benefits payable to contract holders.     The company’s ALM is also integrated with the management of the financial risks associated with the company’s     other financial assets and liabilities not directly associated with insurance and investment liabilities (in particular,     borrowings and investments in foreign operations). The company does not use hedge accounting.     The notes below explain how financial risks are managed using the categories utilised in the company’s ALM     framework.                                                                                                                                 39","ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL      STATEMENTS                  2017  NOTES TO THE  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017    4.2 Financial risk (continued)    Short-term insurance contracts    The company engages in short term insurance contracts and funds the insurance liabilities with a portfolio of    equity and debt securities exposed to market risk. During the year, the company increased the portion of financial    assets invested in debt securities to mitigate the impact of the volatility of equity prices experienced in recent    years. An analysis of the company’s financial assets and its short term insurance liabilities is presented below;    Short-term insurance contracts    Short-term insurance liabilities are not directly sensitive to the level of market interest rates, as they are    undiscounted and contractually noninterest bearing. However, due to the time value of money and the impact    of interest rates on the level of bodily injury incurred by the company’s policyholders (where a reduction of    interest rate would normally produce a higher insurance liability), the company matches the cash flows of assets    and liabilities in this portfolio by estimating their mean duration.    The mean duration of liabilities is calculated using historical claims data to determine the expected settlement    pattern for claims arising from the insurance contracts in force at the statement of financial position date (both    incurred claims and future claims arising from the unexpired risks at the statement of financial position date). The    mean durations are:                                                                    2017           2016                                                                    Years          Years    Net short term insurance liabilities -

The sensitivity analysis for interest          rate risk illustrates how changes in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate          because of changes in market interest rates at the reporting date. For financial instruments and insurance contracts          described in this note, the sensitivity is solely associated with the former, as the carrying amounts of the latter are          not directly affected by changes in market risks.          The company’s management monitors the sensitivity of reported interest rate movements on a monthly basis by          assessing the expected changes in the different portfolios due to a parallel movement of plus 5 percentage points in          all yield curves of financial assets and financial liabilities. These particular exposures illustrate the company’s overall          exposure to interest rate sensitivities included in the company’s ALM framework and its impact in the company’s          profit or loss by business.          An increase percentage points in interest yields would result in additional profit for the period of 2017: Ushs 333          million (2016: Ushs 203 Million).        (ii) Equity price risk          The company’s exposure to equity securities price risk as at year end is not material to the financial statements.        (iii) Currency risk          Foreign currency exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets and liabilities are          denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency. The company primarily transacts in Uganda          Shilling and its assets and liabilities are denominated in the same currency. The company is therefore not exposed          to currency risk.        (b) Credit risk          The company has exposure to credit risk, which is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full          when due. Key areas where the company is exposed to credit risk are:          • reinsurers’ share of insurance liabilities and reserves;          • amounts due from reinsurers in respect of claims already paid;          • amounts due from insurance contract holders;          • amounts due from insurance intermediaries;          The company manages the levels of credit risk it accepts by placing limits on its exposure to a single counterparty,          or groups of counterparty and to geographical and industry segments. Such risks are subject to regular review.          Reinsurance is used to manage insurance risk. This does not, however, discharge the company’s liability as primary          insurer. If a reinsurer fails to pay a claim, the company remains liable for the payment to the policyholder. The          creditworthiness of reinsurers is considered on annual basis by reviewing their financial strength prior to finalisation          of annual contract.          In addition, management assesses the creditworthiness of all reinsurers and intermediaries by reviewing credit          grades provided by rating agencies and other publicly available financial information. The recent payment history          of reinsurers is also used to update the reinsurance purchasing strategy.42","ANNUAL REPORT                                                                                                           AND FINANCIAL                                                                                                           STATEMENTS                                                                                                           2017NOTES TO THEFINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 20174 Risk management objectives and policies (continued)4.2 Financial risk (continued)(b)	 Credit risk (continued)The exposure to individual counterparties is also managed through other mechanisms such as the right of offsetwhere counterparties are both debtors and creditors of the company.

The primaryliquidity risk of the company is the obligation to pay claims to policyholders as they fall due. The projected settlementof these liabilities is modelled, on a regular basis, using actuarial techniques. The board sets limits on the minimumproportion of maturing funds available to meet such calls and on the minimum level of borrowing facilities that shouldbe in place to cover anticipated liabilities and unexpected levels of demand.The table below provides a contractual maturity analysis of the company’s financial liabilities:                                                                                                                           43","ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL      STATEMENTS                  2017  NOTES TO THE  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017    (c) Liquidity risk (continued)    The company maintains an efficient capital structure consistent with the company’s risk profile and the regulatory    and market requirements of its business.    The company’s objectives in managing its capital are:    •	 To match the profile of its assets and liabilities taking account of the risks inherent in the business;    •	 To maintain financial strength to support business growth;    •	 To satisfy the requirements of its policyholders, regulators and rating agencies;    •	 To retain financial flexibility by maintaining strong liquidity and access to a range of capital markets;    •	 To allocate capital efficiently to support growth    •	 To safeguard the company’s ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for       shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders; and    •	 To provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing insurance contracts commensurately with the level of       risk.    An important aspect of the company’s overall capital management process is the setting of a target risk-adjusted    rate of return which is aligned to performance objectives and ensures that the company is focused on the creation    of value for shareholders.    The company has a number of sources of capital available to it and seeks to optimise its equity/debt structure in    order to ensure that it can consistently maximise returns to shareholders. The company considers not only the    traditional sources of capital funding but the alternative sources of capital including reinsurance, as appropriate,    when assessing its deployment and usage of capital. The company manages as capital all items that are eligible to    be treated as such for regulatory purposes.    The company is regulated by uganda’s insurance commission and is subject to insurance solvency regulations which    specify the minimum amount and type of capital that must be held in addition to the insurance liabilities. The    company manages capital in accordance with these rules and has embedded in its alm framework the necessary    tests to ensure continuous and full compliance with such regulations. The company has complied with all externally    imposed capital requirements throughout the year.    The ugandan insurance statute, (1996) requires that each insurance company’s total admitted assets should exceed    the total admitted liabilities by an amount above 15% of net premium.    For purposes of computation of market value in accordance with the ugandan insurance statute (1996), computer    equipment of not more than two years and 100% or all premiums which are no more than 90 days have been    considered.    The insurance act, cap 213, sec 44 specifies that in the case of non-life insurance business, the admitted assets of    the insurer shall exceed the greater of the admitted liabilities of an insurer by a minimum of fifteen percent of the    premium income, net of reinsurance sessions.
