APA has embarked on a marketing campaign to make Kenya a happier place.

The annual report reviews the state of happiness in the world today and shows how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness. And what better way to celebrate and launch great campaign than by bringing much happiness to all our staff, customers and partners, than by hosting an open day at the Apollo Centre in Nairobi. The guests enjoyed free medical check-ups and car clinics.
