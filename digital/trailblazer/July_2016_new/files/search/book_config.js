In partnership with Egerton University, we have created the Ngongogeri Park and every year we plant1000 seedlings with our staff and Egerton students. We are also key partners and sponsors in the annual Run for Mau marathon.On 9th April 2016, together with our staff and Egerton students, we participated in a tree planting exercise inside Egerton University botanicgarden to ensure security and survival of the planted seedlings.We used bamboo seedlings because of their many uses including fencing, construction, supporting farming activities (props and handles forfarm tools), handcrafts, baskets, household furniture (mainly chairs and beds), source of energy (biomass fuel), signage for ceremonies suchas weddings, beer production, tent construction, among others. Among some Kenyan communities, the shoot tips are used for producing analcoholic drink known as Ulanzi. There is, however, high untapped potential commercial uses such as in fabric manufacturing, pulp for paperproduction, several wooden products such as fiber boards, tiles and parquets among others.The environmental value of bamboo is of critical importance in the increasingly degraded Kenyan water towers. Bamboo plays a significantrole in soil conservation, carbon sequestration, nutrients and suspended solids retention and climate modification. As such, it is useful inrehabilitation of degraded sites and reforestation. It is for the above reasons that bamboo should be promoted in Mau and many parts of Kenyaas a way of ensuring sustainable green development benefits (integration of economic development and environmental conservation) throughwood products, energy and environmental conservation.
