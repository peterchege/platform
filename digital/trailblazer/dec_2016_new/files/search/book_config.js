Recruiting a sales agent from zero and watching themgrow into the best in the industry gives me self-satisfaction that nowords could express. Having a team believe that they can achievethe goals they set. The decision to be, have and do something outof the ordinary entails facing difficulties and challenges that areout of the ordinary as well. Sometimes your greatest asset is simplyyour ability to stay with it longer than anyone else.What is failure to you?Failure is just refusing to wake up again, do it all over again. Ihave never met a person, I don’t care what his condition, in whomI could not see possibilities. I don’t care how much a man mayconsider himself a failure, I believe in him, for he can change thething that is wrong in his life anytime he is prepared and ready todo it. Whenever he developed the desire, he can take away fromhis life the thing that is defeating it. The capacity for reformationand change lies within.Book that has made a lasting impression?
